"Job openings unexpectedly increased in May","Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index  Latest Market News  Hot Stocks  Follow:  The “wait-and-see” is turning into a “just-can’t-wait-anymore.”  US employers moved forward on plans to increase their workforces in May, with the number of available jobs rising to a six-month high, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday.  Job openings, which serve as a closely watched measure of labor market demand, totaled an estimated 7.77 million at the end of May, rising from 7.4 million in April, according to the BLS’ latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.  Economists were expecting the number of available jobs to retreat after unexpectedly bouncing higher in April, reflecting an environment where uncertainty has frozen some businesses in their tracks. Consensus estimates were for job openings to total 7.3 million last month, according to FactSet.  Instead, they rose for the second month in a row.  “Business leaders are put in a position now where they have to make decisions in the short term,” Allison Shrivastava, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told CNN in an interview.  Still, Shrivastava cautioned that monthly economic data can be quite volatile (especially from survey-drawn reports like JOLTS that have seen weaker response rates). Job postings tracked by Indeed have remained fairly flat, she noted.  “I wouldn’t take this as a sign of blue skies ahead, by any means,” she added.  Some of the most substantial increases in job postings were at restaurants and hotels, which saw a surge (+314,000) in advance of the summer travel season after openings in that sector hit a low-water mark in April. The finance and insurance industry also saw a sizeable upswing in job openings, Tuesday’s data showed.  While overall hiring activity remained fairly tepid in May — hiring rates were flat or down across most industries — the accommodation and food services sector filled open jobs at a pace last seen in the summer of 2023, a potential indication that there’s optimism that consumers will still continue to spend, especially in discretionary areas, despite broadening economic uncertainty.  President Donald Trump’s sweeping policy moves — including heightened tariffs, moves to reduce immigration, and reduction in federal spending and workers — as well as increased geopolitical tension, have injected incredible uncertainty into the US economy, sending markets on a roller coaster ride, rattling consumers and freezing some business decisions.  It may take some time for these moves, especially on immigration, to be reflected in labor market data, Shrivastava said.  Related article The US economy added 139,000 jobs in May, slightly more than expected  Tuesday’s data is the first in a series of critically important economic metrics released this week about the labor market, culminating with the June jobs report that’s due out on Thursday morning.  Economists are expecting job gains to slow from May, with an estimated 115,000 positions added in June, according to FactSet. They also are forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise to 4.3% from 4.2%.  The monthly JOLTS report showed how US labor market turnover activity is faring at a time when concern is growing that job growth may be slowing too much.  “As tariff worries fade, businesses are adopting a more optimistic view and are looking to bring on more workers,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote on Tuesday. “Hiring has been stuck at unusually low levels for over a year. But there’s hope the ‘white-collar job recession’ could finally end as finance and insurance firms are posting more roles.”  Tuesday’s data showed that the labor market remains a bit gridlocked as the churn seen in stronger economic times has slowed. The hiring rate (as a percentage of total employment) continues to hover near 10-year lows.  The closely watched “quits rate,” which serves as both a gauge of employee confidence as well as an indicator of future wage growth, was 2.1% in May, remaining well below the average rate of the past five years.  However, despite the stalling in hiring and quitting, layoff activity hasn’t significantly accelerated.  Layoffs fell in May to 1.6 million, staying below pre-pandemic levels. The rate of layoffs remains near record lows, according to BLS JOLTS data that dates back to December 2000.  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

"Elon Musk and Donald Trump are fighting again","Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index  Latest Market News  Hot Stocks  Follow:  The truce between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump didn’t even last a month.  After the Senate narrowly passed a procedural vote to debate Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” over the weekend, Musk on Monday said he would use his vast resources to launch primary campaigns against Republicans in Congress who voted for the massive domestic policy agenda. Musk spent much of Monday and early Tuesday morning posting and re-posting messages that criticize the tax cut and spending bill — particularly for its sky-high cost.  Trump late Monday night fought back, suggesting his administration may investigate Musk’s companies’ massive government contracts. On Tuesday at the White House, Trump said Musk risked losing “a lot more” than government subsidies and threatened that the Department of Government Efficiency that Musk once led may become a monster that will “go back and eat Elon.”  So far, the feud hasn’t grown as personal or as vicious as their public blow-up last month when Musk, without providing evidence, accused Trump of withholding information about disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and claiming that Trump’s name was included in the government’s so-called Epstein files.  A week after the peak of that feud, Musk said he regretted some of his posts about Trump. Musk deleted some of his most inflammatory X posts, including the one relating to Epstein and another agreeing with the suggestion that Trump should be impeached. Musk had since softened his tone about Trump and the bill, largely shifting his focus on social media and in interviews to his companies.  That shifted dramatically Monday when Musk began posting nonstop about his opposition to Trump’s signature legislation.  This time around, Musk seems to be holding himself back from attacking Trump directly. In response to a video of Trump’s comments about have DOGE go after Musk, he wrote on X, “So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.”  Still, the fight is costing Musk where it counts: Tesla’s (TSLA) stock tumbled 7% in Tuesday after losing 2% on Monday, missing out on the broader stock market gains that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs. Much of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla’s publicly traded stock.  Tesla shareholders have been very sensitive to the Musk-Trump spat, nervous that Trump may make good on his threat to dissolve contracts with SpaceX or Tesla. The stock lost about 14% on June 4, the day when Musk and Trump’s feud over the spending bill erupted into the public.  “This BFF situation has now turned into a soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla’s stock with investors fearing that the Trump Administration will be more hawkish and show scrutiny around Musk-related US government spending,” said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note to investors Tuesday. “Tesla investors want Musk to focus on driving Tesla and stop this political angle.”  Musk’s renewed attacks on the bill started Monday afternoon, when he threatened members of Congress who voted for the legislation. He said the bill would undermine his efforts at DOGE which sought fiscal responsibility by eliminating what he and others viewed as wasteful spending.  Related article Elon Musk just made his starkest political threat since the election  But the Senate bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate released Sunday. The Senate legislation costs more than the House-approved bill, which would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.  The White House has argued the bill “slashes deficits” and the debt, while “unleashing economic growth.” Musk wasn’t having it.  “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame! And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” he wrote on X.  He later shared a campaign poster with “LIAR” written across Pinocchio’s face above the text “Voted to increase America’s debt by $5,000,000,000,000.”  “Anyone who campaigned on the PROMISE of REDUCING SPENDING, but continues to vote on the BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY will see their face on this poster in the primary next year,” Musk wrote.  Musk wrote several posts about creating a third party called “the America Party,” which would serve as a populist alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties.  “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,” Musk said.  He also posted that he would contribute to the re-election campaign for Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who has been one of the few Republican voices in Congress to take a stand against the bill. Trump has publicly scolded Massie for his opposition.  Trump early Tuesday morning responded with a threat: He could use DOGE to probe the government contracts and subsidies Musk’s companies receive.  “Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”  On Tuesday at the White House, Trump said Musk risked serious losses from his opposition to the bill.  “He’s upset that he’s losing his EV mandate,” Trump said. “He could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you right now. Elon could lose a lot more than that.”  When asked if Trump would want to deport Musk, a US citizen, Trump said, “I don’t know, we’ll have to take a look.”  “We might have to put DOGE on Elon,” Trump added. “You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies. Elon’s very upset that the EV mandate is going to be terminated.”  Related article Musk called Trump Monday night before expressing regret for harshest criticism of the president  Trump made a similar suggestion last month. Although it’s not clear that Trump would follow through, Musk’s companies are reliant on the federal government as a major source of revenue. And Tesla, SpaceX and Musk’s other companies, including social media platform X, artificial intelligence company xAI and brain-computer interface company Neuralink all face regulation from the federal government.  Unlike SpaceX, which makes the bulk of its money from the government, Tesla has relatively few government contracts. But numerous federal policies directly affect Tesla’s finances, including a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle buyers that allows Tesla and other automakers to raise prices. The tax credit has also has helped boost EV sales. That was likely worth billions to Tesla last year alone.  Tesla also reported more than $8 billion in sales over six years of regulatory credits to other automakers to help them comply with federal and state emission standards. Trump is in favor of rolling back those standards and stripping states of the power to set their own emissions rules, which would destroy the market for those credit sales.  The loss of the EV tax credit could cost Tesla $1.2 billion a year and the loss of regulatory credit sales another $2 billion, according to JPMorgan.  “At the end of the day being on Trump’s bad side will not turn out well, and Musk knows this,” Ives wrote.  Trump has argued that Musk’s primary opposition to the Big, Beautiful Bill is the loss of EV tax credits. Musk denies that, retweeting a post Monday that said, “Elon’s opposition to the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ has never been about its removal of EV tax credits or the EV mandate, it’s simply about his passionate opposition to rising government debt.”  “All I’m asking is that we don’t bankrupt America,” Musk posted.  It’s unclear whether Musk’s threats will kill the bill’s chances. Trump has mounted a massive pressure campaign on holdouts, putting members of Congress in a difficult position of choosing Musk and his war chest of cash or Trump and his bully pulpit.  Musk spent more than $275 million to support Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election. According to Federal Election Commission filings, Musk’s political action committee, America PAC, last gave money in March to support two Republican candidates running in special elections in Florida — Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis. In late May he said in an interview he was planning to cut back on political spending, saying he has “done enough.”  But Musk has the resources to make good on his promises to support a slate of alternate candidates if he chooses.  That doesn’t guarantee he’ll succeed: Musk spent considerable time and resources in a losing effort to elect a Republican to Wisconsin’s supreme court earlier this year. His popularity remains low, and, ultimately, Donald Trump is president, and Musk is not.  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

"A plea deal is set to end the yearslong case against Bryan Kohberger. The family of one of his alleged victims is furious","The grieving family of 21-year-old Kaylee Goncalves spent weeks waiting for an arrest in her killing. Since then, they and relatives of the three other University of Idaho students fatally stabbed on a late 2022 night in their off-campus home have endured a legal process punctuated by delay after delay.  Now, a month before the suspect’s murder trial was set to begin, the wait for justice is poised to end in what one Goncalves family member called a “shocking and cruel” plea deal that would remove the possibility of the death penalty.  “After more than two years, this is how it concludes — with a secretive deal and a hurried effort to close the case without any input from the victims’ families on the plea’s details,” the Goncalves family said in a statement shared with CNN.  The plea deal would bring an abrupt end to a case that has captured national attention since the four brutal killings rocked the small college town of Moscow. Bryan Kohberger, a 30-year-old former PhD student of criminology at nearby Washington State University, was charged in January 2023 with fatally stabbing Goncalves; Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle, both 20; and Madison Mogen, 21.  Under the deal, Kohberger will plead guilty to four counts of murder in exchange for the government dropping the death penalty, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Goncalves family attorney Shanon Gray confirmed the deal to CNN, which has reached out to the families of Chapin and Mogen about the pending agreement.  “This isn’t what we should be doing,” Kaylee’s father, Steve Goncalves, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday, adding, “You don’t deal with terrorists and you don’t deal with people who kill your kids in their sleep. So we’ll never, we’ll never see this as justice.”  Xana’s father, Jeff Kernodle, also expressed his issues with the deal.  “I do not agree with this outcome and expressed my concerns before the deal was negotiated, especially regarding what I believed would be the best capital punishment,” Kernodle said in a statement Tuesday. “After nearly three years of waiting and being told there would be a trial, with evidence presented to convict him, I’m disappointed in the (prosecutors’) decision.”  A hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET in front of Judge Steven Hippler, a court document shows; it will deal with the plea agreement, a letter from the prosecutor to a victim’s family says, the Idaho Statesman reported. The Goncalves family has asked prosecutors to delay Wednesday’s hearing to give them more time to get to Boise, the family’s lawyer told the Associated Press.  Hippler, a Boise native, was appointed as a district judge by former Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter for the 4th Judicial District Court in 2013.  “Death row is the only place where they’re actually treated as true criminals. And it’s sad that this individual won’t be treated like a criminal,” Goncalves told Sciutto.  “The offer was made on a Sunday, and then two days later, we’re supposed to go to court on Fourth of July weekend? Can people not see what’s going on here?” Goncalves said. “This is ridiculous. Nothing moved in this case for a year. And then in three days, it’s over.”  Jury selection in Kohberger’s murder trial was set to begin August 4. Prosecutors previously indicated they would pursue the death penalty.  The Goncalves family wasn’t “even called about the plea” and merely “received an email with a letter attached,” they said in a social media post.  The letter, sent to the victims’ families from Moscow Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson, indicates Kohberger will likely be sentenced to life in prison if he pleads guilty and the deal requires him to waive his right to appeal, the Idaho Statesman reported.  Still, the Goncalves family blasted prosecutors’ “very unexpected” decision, writing in a short social media post: “We are beyond furious at the State of Idaho. They have failed us.”  By contrast, Madison Mogen’s father is choosing acceptance, he told the Idaho Statesman, saying the plea agreement would let his family avoid a trial and allow its wounds to keep healing.  If Kohberger were given a death sentence, he wouldn’t “have to spend decades thinking” about “how terrible (he) made the world,” Ben Mogen told “CBS Mornings.”  “We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don’t want to have to be at, that we shouldn’t have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,” Mogen told CBS. “We get to just think about the rest of our lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and without the rest of the kids.”  Thompson’s office could not comment on news of the plea deal because of a wide-ranging gag order in the case, he told CNN. In the letter to the Goncalves family, the prosecutor defended the deal as “our sincere attempt to seek justice for your family,” arguing it will ensure Kohberger “will spend the rest of his life in prison,” the Statesman reported.  In a lengthier statement posted by the Goncalves family, Kaylee’s 18-year-old sister, Aubrie, took issue with the suddenness of the deal after a painfully long legal process, calling it “both shocking and cruel” to bring it to the families “just weeks before the scheduled trial.”  “Had this proposal come a year and a half ago, the families could have had time to process, discuss, and potentially come to terms with the idea of a life sentence – however difficult that may be,” the statement said.  The latest pretrial developments in the Idaho student killings case  The Goncalves family is “not asking for vengeance,” Aubrie wrote, but considers the possibility of life in prison an unfair outcome.  “Bryan Kohberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships, and engage with the world. Meanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever,” she wrote.  The possibility of the death penalty has loomed large over the proceedings, with Kohberger’s defense team repeatedly arguing for it to be taken off the table.  “We all know he’s guilty,” Steve Goncalves told NewsNation. “There’s more than enough evidence, but it’s tough to put a community through this, and it could be bad for reputations and business identities, and there’s fallout, but this isn’t the will of the victims.”  “This is just one person making a decision,” he added, “and it doesn’t reflect what we were asking for.”  The victims’ families have lived through a sprawling case, starting with a wait for a suspect to be identified. For weeks, law enforcement released few details about the investigation. Then on December 30, 2022 – more than a month after the November 13 killings – Kohberger was arrested in his home state of Pennsylvania.  Bryan Kohberger agrees to plea deal to avoid death penalty in Idaho student killings  Kohberger’s arrest was based largely on DNA evidence, including a sample found on a knife sheath near one of the victims’ beds and DNA retrieved from trash outside the Kohberger family home, prosecutors said.  Since then, the legal case has been marked by delays, including when Kohberger kept silent during his May 2023 arraignment when a judge asked for his plea on the murder and burglary charges outlined in an indictment against him.  “Your honor, we are standing silent,” Kohberger’s attorney said before the judge entered not guilty pleas for him.  As the case proceeded, the defense team filed motions to suppress DNA evidence obtained through the forensic genealogy process and questioning the validity of other evidence, including cell phone records and the accuracy of a search warrant affidavit.  Kohberger’s trial was pushed back multiple times amid disputes over evidence and witnesses. Last September, it was moved from Latah County, where the crime took place, to the state capital of Boise.  Last year, the Goncalves family expressed its frustration at the repeated delays, saying the case had turned into a “hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions.”  Recent rulings narrowed Kohberger’s legal defense options heading into trial. The judge had barred the defense from submitting an official alibi, as no one could confirm Kohberger’s whereabouts at the time of the killings.  Last week, the judge rejected the defense’s attempt to present an “alternate perpetrator” theory. Kohberger’s lawyers had planned to argue one of four other people committed the murders, but the judge ruled there was no evidence beyond “pure speculation” to support the claim.

"â€˜Sense of doomâ€™: Morale plunges as some VA health workers fear worsening shortages, staffing cuts","Follow:  In her 34 years working as a nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Georgia, Irma Westmoreland has seen it all — from patients exposed to Agent Orange to traumatic brain injuries and amputations suffered in combat.  But now, it is the turmoil at the Department of Veterans Affairs that is leaving her shaken. “It is very jarring,” she told CNN. “The nurses, they’re afraid.”  Morale among doctors and nurses at Veterans Affairs hospitals has plunged, according to more than a dozen medical professionals at hospitals across the country as well as union officials who spoke to CNN.  They are worried about support staff being laid off after President Donald Trump took office in January despite an already strained medical system with staffing shortages, hiring freezes and attrition. And they are worried about the VA’s goal — on hold for now — to reduce its 470,000-person workforce by some 15%.  Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins has vowed that doctors and nurses will be exempt from any layoff plans.  But some staff who handle administration, billing, and running facilities have already left, leaving doctors and nurses to do those jobs on top of practicing medicine.  “As they lay off support staff, like our dietary staff, our housekeeping staff and the staff that support us, then we’re going to be having to take on those jobs,” Westmoreland, who is also a top nurses union representative, said. “That means our patients are going to have to wait longer for the treatment and care that they deserve and they need, and that’s our concern.”  Peter Kasperowicz, a spokesman for the VA, said many staff members who had been laid off have been asked back, and the “vast majority” have returned.  However, frontline workers who spoke to CNN say they have only felt the decline in staffing, and fear more to come.  They say supplies have gone unordered, appointments go unscheduled, and medical staff fear that these conditions might not only encourage doctors and nurses now working in the over-strained system to quit, but dry up the pipeline for future talent to care for the country’s veterans.  “I joined the VA for stability,” one doctor said. “But why would anyone want to come here?”  First created by executive order in 1930, the Department of Veteran Affairs has gone through many iterations.  Today, the Cabinet-level agency serves some 9 million US veterans per year, assisting them with everything from interment at military cemeteries to all aspects of their healthcare.  Its hospitals, outpatient centers, and affiliated medical services number over a thousand, making them one of largest health systems in the country. Hospital and medical services accounted for 42% of the VA’s $302 billion spending in 2023, according to the Peterson Institute, an economics think tank.  As President Donald Trump took office in January, plans for cuts to the VA quickly emerged as part of the new administration’s broad promises to dramatically reduce the size of government.  Asked about its plans under the Trump administration, Kasperowicz said: “The fact is that during the Biden Administration, VA failed to address nearly all of its most serious problems, such as benefits backlogs and rising health care wait times.”  “Under President Trump and Secretary Collins, VA is fixing these and other serious problems,” he continued. “We owe it to America’s Veterans to take a close look at how VA is currently functioning and whether current policies are leading to the best outcomes for Veterans.”  He disputed that there were morale issues among VA health professionals and blamed the media for “fear mongering.”  Almost no federal agency has been spared from the slashes, but with a target of laying off some 70,000 people, the VA cuts would be among the more dramatic. Sources at the agency and on Capitol Hill previously told CNN the first significant round of layoffs was planned to begin this month, with a second round planned to begin in September.  This comes as VA hospitals were already facing critical shortages, with over 80% of VA hospitals reporting doctor and nursing shortages in the 2024 fiscal year that was then compounded by limits to hiring introduced last year under the Biden administration.  Over the years, there have been numerous bipartisan criticisms of, and calls to reform, the agency. Its spending, bureaucracy, quality and ability to provide services have all faced scrutiny over the years and across administrations.  Collins, the VA secretary, has argued he is trying to improve the system by cutting bureaucracy and standardizing practices, leading to better care for veterans.  Kasperowicz told CNN that since Trump took office, the agency has reduced disabilities claims backlogs, opened 13 new clinics, and accelerated integrating an electronic records system, among other successes.  “VA is undergoing a holistic review centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” he said.  “The goal is to implement a reduction in force (RIF) that could affect as much as 15% of VA’s workforce, or about 70,000 people. But those reductions have not happened yet,” he said. “As we reform VA, we are guided by the fact that the Biden Administration added tens of thousands of new VA employees and tens of billions in additional VA spending, and the department’s performance got worse.”  However, plans for potential layoffs drew alarm from both sides of the aisle. Republicans questioned the wisdom of the targeted numbers, and some Democrats pointed out that the plans come even as there is a current shortage of hospital staff.  Amid this scrutiny, Collins noted to VA employees at a town hall in June that the “reduction-in-force,” or layoff plan, “has been put on hold,” though he added that he expected this hold “to be lifted at some point that allows us to go and look at what we may be doing.” In May, a federal judge had halted plans for the layoffs at several agencies, pending further legal reviews.  The town hall, a recording of which was shared with CNN, drew some 7,000 questions from VA employees, a fifth of which were about the layoff plans.  Collins has repeatedly said the cuts would not affect doctors and nurses, and suggested during the event that “the people there cleaning the rooms, doing the sterilizations” should not be targeted for layoffs.  The agency has exempted “more than 350,000 occupations from the hiring freeze,” Kasperowicz noted in a statement to CNN. “These roles provide and support the direct mission of providing medical care and services to our veterans.”  When CNN spoke to a dozen VA hospital employees across the country, however, some said doctors were voluntarily leaving because of the strain on the workforce and the supply chain. Most spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from their employers. They were even reluctant to publicly disclose the state or facility where they work.  “There’s a sense of doom hanging over your head,” one VA doctor in the central US said.  A nurse at an eastern US VA hospital said: “A lot of employees feel like they’re under attack” at that facility. There is “pervasive fear everywhere,” said a doctor at a southern US VA hospital.  Westmoreland, the nurse at Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, fears patients will ultimately bear the brunt of the consequences, even as medical staff scramble to do what they can.  “We already had shortages,” Westmoreland said. “And so if you already have a shortage and then you put more pressure on that, what are you going to do? It’s just going to make it worse.”  A new state-of-the-art health clinic in Fredericksburg, Virginia, lays bare some of those challenges.  Opened to much fanfare in February this year, the more than 470,000- square- foot facility was billed as a “significant milestone for VA to continue delivering world-class health care to our veterans in Spotsylvania County and beyond,” according to the VA news release.  The center is intended to provide primary care, mental health, rehabilitation service and specialty care like cardiology, neurology and dermatology for some 35,000 veterans each year and to bring some 900 new jobs to the area.  It was opened to relieve overcrowding at other VA hospitals in the region.  When CNN spoke to two patients who had sought care at the facility in April, they said it felt clearly short-staffed. “It was a ghost town,” said Lt. Col. Janice Sierra, who is retired from the US Army Reserve.  Sierra and retired Navy veteran Van Elder told CNN at the time that the pharmacy was not open, X-rays were not available, and the women’s clinic was not open. “I’d call it pitiful,” Elder said. “It was just a virtually empty place.”  Asked about the staff shortage at the time, VA Secretary Collins said it was to be expected that the Fredericksburg clinic would not be fully-staffed initially, but that the agency would ramp up staffing. “When you open new facilities, you open them in phases,” Collins told CNN’s Jake Tapper in April.  “When false stories get out there that [these facilities] they’re not opening fully staffed because of things that we’ve done, that’s just a lie,” he said, adding that it would be “fully equipped by the later this year, which is exactly the way it was supposed to open.”  The pharmacy at Fredericksburg has recently opened. But as of late June, Elder said the radiology wing still had not opened. He said the staff recently told him he needed to go to the VA Medical Center in Richmond, an hour away.  When he got there, Elder saw a sign in the radiology department saying: “Notice: Severe Staffing Shortage; Wait times will be longer than anticipated.” Elder shared a photograph of the sign with CNN.  The VA spokesman told CNN that the “VA Fredericksburg Health Care Center’s phased opening and staffing plan is right on schedule. The clinic started with approximately 230 team members, and it now employs 289 people, with another 266 in various stages of recruitment,” and that x-ray services would be open in late July.  He attributed the lack of radiologists at the Richmond site to a national shortage, noting that radiologists are exempt from any hiring freeze. “The Richmond VAMC is actively recruiting more radiologists, and because Richmond VAMC patients can access radiology services at VA or in the community when needed, there have been no delays or negative impacts to patient care,” Kasperowicz, the VA spokesman, said.  In this climate, medical professionals who spoke to CNN said an added dose of stress has been a lack of support staff such as supply clerks and administrators.  They say this has forced frontline medical workers to take on these tasks themselves — with limited success.  The ordering of supplies and equipment came to a halt, said the doctor at the central US VA hospital, while a doctor at another VA hospital said physicians and nurses there are now servicing medical equipment and making patient appointments.  “This is like a death by a thousand cuts,” that doctor said. “They’re trying to make life difficult. They’re trying to make people quit.”  The senior VA doctor from the southern US hospital told CNN that they were preparing rooms before their appointments. “I change the paper on exam tables. All the doctors do,” the person said.  Westmoreland, the longtime nurse in Augusta, told CNN that shortages are so bad at her hospital they are even low on portable jugs to collect urine from bed-bound patients, forcing nurses to have to “call around from unit to unit to unit to try to find a urinal [jug].”  Even when one is found, there is no one to bring them up. “The supply area’s locked up because they don’t have enough staff,” said Westmoreland, who CNN met at a rally for veterans and union members in Washington, DC. “And it’s very disheartening to the nurses because I’m trying to take care of my patients, and I’m having to run around and find something that I should have in the cabinet,” she said.  “Who’s on the other side of that shortage?” she said. “A veteran who stood on the line for us, for our country, and he deserves better care than that.”  Kasperowicz told CNN nurses at the hospital “have access” to the urinals when they need them and a person who has keys is available to unlock the supply closet. He added that “there is no scenario in which VA will require doctors to perform anything other than their normal patient care duties.”  Regardless of whether or when more layoffs happen, doctors who spoke to CNN agreed that they are concerned that patient care will worsen.  “I’m going to fail,” one doctor said, “because I can’t do budgeting, hiring actions, scheduling actions” on top of treating patients.  © 2025 Cable News Network.

"Making big financial decisions when the world is giving you heartburn","Markets  Hot Stocks  Fear & Greed Index  Latest Market News  Hot Stocks  When you’re making a big financial decision – whether to buy a house, change careers, retire, etc. – chances are you already have a number of concerns.  But add to those a series of external events that seem tailor-made to tweak anyone’s financial anxiety.  Among other things, in just the past six months:  Through it all you’ve been living your life and trying to make smart financial decisions.  CNN talked with three certified financial therapists, two of whom are also certified financial planners, about how to handle a big decision if external factors are adding to your concerns about whether to make a move. Here are five steps they recommend.  Regardless of your political leanings, there is a lot going on these days that can feel unsettling, uncertain or upsetting.  “We’re in this period of perceived perma-crisis. For some, it can be paralytic. For others, it causes people to act rashly or impulsively,” said Joel Roberts, founder and CEO of Brescor Wealth Advisory in Massachusetts.  He calls it “financial freeze or flight.”  And that may be on top of other anxieties about, say, your industry, which could reduce your feelings of job security.  When a client considers making an extreme financial move to protect themselves from external events, Rick Kahler, founder of Advanced Wellbeing in South Dakota, empathizes with them.  “We tell clients whatever their concerns, it’s legitimate to discuss,” Kahler said.  But he tries to draw them out further. If, for example, a client says they want to get out of stocks altogether, he lets them know he can get them the cash tomorrow if they’d like. Then he’ll suggest they map out how such a move would affect their financial situation.  “It helps them be conscious and make informed decisions,” he said.  After unpacking their concerns, he may recommend an intermediary solution, such as reducing but not eliminating their stock exposure. He said, usually the client realizes that the intermediary solution is enough to let them sleep better at night.  Whenever a client expresses fears about, say, buying a home and then losing a job, Aja Evans, board president at the Financial Therapy Association and author of “Feel-Good Finance,” will encourage them to reality-test those fears. (The FTA certifies financial therapists.)  “We go to the worst-case scenarios in their heads,” Evans said. Then she’ll ask them to consider, “What do you have in place to safeguard against that?”  For instance, she noted, they might consider whether they have a robust emergency fund or recall how they successfully handled financial insecurity in the past.  No one can predict the future, so advancing or holding off on a purchase or essential financial move because of concerns over where tariffs, interest rates or stocks are going may not serve you well.  Better to take the emotion out of the equation, Kahler said, and instead ask yourself honestly: Is this something you need? Will this enhance your life today? Does this make sense as an investment?  “Because the problem with timing a purchase is who knows?” he said.  Or, as Roberts put it, “Uncertainty is the norm. You can’t wait for perfect clarity.”  Staying focused on your biggest needs and goals is critical.  As unnerving or worrying as a conflict abroad or protests in another city are, they’re not likely to have a direct impact on your finances. So distinguish between the information that is and isn’t relevant to your decision, Roberts suggested.  Ditto big swings in the market or a quarter-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.  Say you’re under contract to buy a home, Roberts said. “If you’re 90% of the way there, should a single stat change your decision-making process?”  Probably not, he said. There’s always going to be some number somewhere suggesting you’re making the wrong choice.  In other words, he said, “build a greater emotional tolerance to the noise.”  Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

"What we know about Wess Roley, the 20-year-old suspect in the Idaho fire shooting","The man who police believe killed two Idaho firefighters responding to a brush fire after starting the flames himself had wanted to pursue a career in the fire service, his grandfather told CNN.  Wess Roley was identified by a law enforcement official as the suspect in the Sunday shooting in Coeur d’Alene. Two firefighters were killed and a third was injured. Roley, who was found dead at the scene and appears to have shot himself, set the brush ablaze with a flint fire starter, authorities said.  Roley’s grandfather, Dale Roley, told CNN his 20-year-old grandson came from a family of arborists and had been working in the tree service industry while trying to figure out his career path.  The firefighters killed and injured in Sunday’s attack had nearly 70 years combined experience. Here’s what we know  Police say Wess Roley opened fire on the first responders from a tree, citing extensive experience climbing with his family. His motive remains unknown – and no manifesto has been found.  “He wanted to be a fireman – he was doing tree work and he wanted to be a fireman in the forest,” Dale Roley said. “As far as I know, he was actually pursuing it.”  Wess Roley owned a shotgun and a long rifle, his grandfather said. Investigators are confident a shotgun was used in the Sunday attack but have stopped short of ruling out additional firearms.  Dale Roley said he typically spoke with his grandson on a weekly basis, but they hadn’t spoken in the last month because Wess Roley had lost his phone. He said the suspect had loving family and friends, and he vacationed in Hawaii with his mother last year, according to social media posts.  Officials said it appeared Wess Roley was living out of his vehicle, which remains on the scene and has not been inventoried.  “It wasn’t like he was a loner,” Dale Roley told CNN. “We had no reason to suspect that he would be involved in something like this.” He said he was holding out hope that his grandson wasn’t actually the shooter.  Roley previously lived in California, Arizona and Idaho, authorities said. A running website said that he ran track at a high school in Arizona and was a member of the school’s class of 2024.  Two former Arizona classmates of Roley’s painted a picture of a struggling student who occasionally lashed out in anger. He could be friendly at times, they said, but was seclusive from his peers.  A third former classmate described Roley as sometimes “verbally aggressive,” but echoed that he had the means to be friendly and fun.  “He would make us laugh so hard,” the classmate said. They would play with airsoft guns and video games, but sometimes “it was difficult to play with him… you would take him in doses.”  Court documents show that Roley had a tumultuous family life growing up. His mother filed for divorce in September 2015, when her son was 10 years old, and wrote in court documents that her husband had threatened her, pushed her to the ground, and “punched several holes in the walls.”  “He threatened to sit outside my house with a sniper rifle or burn my house down,” she wrote.  A judge granted a protective order preventing Roley’s father from having contact with his wife or son, but later amended the order to remove the son after his father wrote in a court filing that “I am not a danger to my son or anyone else” and that his wife “did not tell the truth in her statement.”  The divorce was granted in November 2015, and Roley’s mother was designated as his “primary residential parent.”  Roley’s stepfather described in a statement confusion and heartbreak among his family members who are still struggling to grapple with Sunday’s tragedy.  “We do not understand why this happened or how this came about,” the statement, released by Tony Cuchiara’s attorney, read. “Our hearts and spirits are broken for the lost and hurting, and for our own loss as well.”  The suspect himself has no criminal history, officials said. However, law enforcement in Kootenai County, Idaho, had minor interactions with him five times.  He has relatives near Coeur d’Alene, but it is unclear what he was doing in the area at the time of the shooting, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said.  “We knew that he lived here for the better part of 2024, but as far as when he got here, why he was here, why he chose this place, I don’t know,” Norris said.  TJ Franks, a former roommate of Roley’s, told CNN affiliate KING he was “freaking out really bad” when he learned Roley was involved in the shooting.  Franks and Roley met through the tree service industry and lived together in an apartment in Sandpoint, Idaho, for about six months, until Roley moved out in January, Franks told KING. Roley left the apartment after making “threatening gestures” to a security camera, which led to a 911 call, the KING report said.  “My whole family met him. It was just scary, because, I don’t know, he could have flipped at any time,” Franks said. The two never had a conversation that may have hinted at a motive, Franks told KING.  “I never thought we would see something like this happening, especially with somebody that we know; it’s really heartbreaking and scary,” Franks added.  Roley’s father told a CNN reporter outside his home in Priest River, Idaho, that he wasn’t close with his son and hadn’t seen him since a family gathering last year. He didn’t respond to follow-up phone calls about the decade-old allegations in the court documents. The suspect’s mother also didn’t answer phone calls Monday morning.

"â€˜This is not a luxuryâ€™: Families in Trump states agonize over GOPâ€™s proposed Medicaid cuts","Follow:  Courtney Leader has been closely following the contentious tax-and-spending debate in Washington – not that she cares much for politics, but because she believes the proposed Medicaid cuts are a matter of life or death for her daughter.  “This is not a luxury. I do not have my daughter enrolled on Medicaid so we can have fancy things,” Leader said. “I have my daughter enrolled in Medicaid so we can keep her alive and keep her at home, which I think is the best option for her.”  As the Senate opened a marathon voting session Monday on the Republican bill containing President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, the real-world implications are playing out across the country at kitchen tables of parents like Leader, whose 9-year-old daughter with brain damage and cerebral palsy relies on Medicaid benefits for daily care and weekly therapy.  She wrote to Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, hoping to put a face on the Medicaid debate. She explained that her husband works as a carpenter, whose private insurance provides health coverage for the couple and their four other children. She said costly medical bills for their daughter, Cyrina, were too much for any household to bear.  “Without Medicaid,” Leader told her senator, “we would lose everything – our home, our vehicles and, eventually, our daughter.”  Hawley did not identify Leader by name, but he shared her family’s story in a New York Times essay last month as he first emerged as a rare Republican warning his party against cutting Medicaid for some of the 70 million low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program. He called such a move “morally wrong and politically suicidal.”  After pushing Senate leaders to include a $25 billion fund to help rural hospitals, Hawley said he would support the bill. But he previewed the risks ahead for his fellow Republicans about deep cuts to Medicaid, saying: “You cannot be a working-class party if you are taking away health care for working-class people.”  Related article Trump’s massive agenda bill faces headwinds in the Senate after key ruling from chamber’s rules referee  It’s a pivotal moment in the tug-of-war over Trump’s priorities, the centerpiece of which is a sweeping package to extend tax cuts to some of the wealthiest Americans, while reducing social safety-net programs for health care, food assistance and rural hospitals. The president has pledged not to cut Medicaid, even though the current version of the measure would do just that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and add more than $2 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.  A visit to Missouri, where at least one in five residents depend on Medicaid for health coverage, offered a snapshot of the potential fallout from the sprawling legislation the president and Republicans have branded as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.  “I know that they’re saying they’re not planning to cut Medicaid, right?” said Leader, 36. “But I reached out, concerned that if any changes are made, there will be this trickle-down effect that will impact families like mine.”  As she stood in her kitchen, getting ready to drive Cyrina to a morning therapy session about 30 minutes away, Leader ticked through the costs to sustain her daughter, who was shaken by a caregiver when she was four months old, leading to her condition. She has a complex web of medical and developmental challenges, but can stay in their home because of a nurse and weekly therapy appointments, the co-pays of which are paid by Medicaid, along with a feeding tube, formula and a litany of other supplies.  “The formula that is delivered through a tube in her stomach costs more than my mortgage,” Leader said. “It costs more than my entire food budget for our family and in that alone, there is no way that we could come up with that $1,500 to be able to feed her.”  While the legislation does not directly call for cutting benefits for medically complex cases, Leader believes that some existing services are still at risk, particularly in-home care that keeps her daughter out of a nursing home. She must recertify for coverage every year – on Cyrina’s birthday in May – and believes any significant changes to programs administered by the state will add another layer of bureaucracy that she and other parents routinely endure.  “Who’s going to protect us when they can’t get paperwork done in time and we lose coverage for a month or two?” Leader said, her voice rising with emotion as she raised concerns about state-level backlogs. “I’m worried that the red tape is going to affect our Medicaid because of just the oversight burdens and that as a result, I’m going to lose my daughter because she’s lost coverage before.”  The Senate version of the bill is poised to make even deeper cuts to Medicaid than the measure the House narrowly passed in May. It is among the differences that must be reconciled if both chambers pass the legislation, which Trump is still pressing them to do before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.  More than 1,000 miles away from Washington, inside the bright hallways of Golden Valley Memorial Healthcare in Clinton, Missouri, a sense of anxiety over the Medicaid debate was evident on a recent afternoon.  The 50-bed hospital is not only a critical piece of the economy as the largest employer in Henry County, but also the only maternity ward and emergency room for about an hour’s drive in each direction across this stretch of western Missouri.  “We are paying very close attention because we want to make sure that those Medicaid benefits are preserved so our patients can continue to access care that they need,” said Craig Thompson, CEO of Golden Valley Memorial. “For rural hospitals like ours, it’s ranchers, it’s farmers, it’s small business owners and it’s a whole lot of kids.”  About four out of five patients admitted to the hospital, he said, depend on Medicaid, the health care program for lower-income Americans, or Medicare, the program for seniors. Severe cuts to Medicaid, he said, would unnecessarily send more people to the emergency room and have devastating effects on his and other rural hospitals across the state.  Last fall, Trump carried this rural county with 76% of the vote, which was 17 points higher than his Missouri victory. Yet the politics of health care is complicated, even here in Trump country, where voters also approved a statewide Medicaid expansion measure four years earlier.  Before that vote, Medicaid in the state was largely restricted to the elderly, disabled or pregnant. The expansion vote allowed about 340,000 Missourians to enroll in the program, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health, the funding of which is now uncertain, amid new work requirements and a long list of provisions.  “I think there’s a perception that Medicaid beneficiaries are respondent or even lazy, for lack of a better term,” Thompson said. “That’s simply not what we see on a daily basis.”  Dr. Jennifer Blair, who grew up about 45 miles away in the small Missouri town of Peculiar, said she fears maternity wards at hospitals like Golden Valley are at risk if some of the deep Medicaid cuts are realized.  “We are surrounded by several maternity care deserts, which is defined as a county that has no or very limited access to obstetric services for their patients,” Blair said. “If we were to lose that access to the birthing center here at Golden Valley, our patients would have to travel more than 60 miles.”  Long before the House passed nearly $300 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, signs of increasing need have been clear at Ozarks Food Harvest, a 100,000-square-foot warehouse on the edge of Springfield. It serves about 30 million meals every year across one-third of Missouri.  “The demand for food is quite a bit higher than it was even at the height of the Covid crisis,” said Bart Brown, president and CEO of the non-profit food program. “We are seeing lots of new families that we’ve never seen before.”  The SNAP program has always been solely funded by the federal government. The House measure called for passing along considerable costs to state governments, which are already facing difficult choices and balanced-budget requirements.  The move would have saved the federal government more than $128 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which House Republicans hoped to use to help cover the costs of extending the tax cuts. The Senate parliamentarian removed the provision on procedural grounds, making it one of the key differences the Senate and House must reconcile before passing the legislation.  June Owens isn’t closely following the back-and-forth of the debate in Washington.  She arrived in a strip mall parking lot in nearby Marshfield shortly after 6 a.m. on a recent rainy morning, so she could get a spot near the front of a long and winding line of cars and trucks. She rolled down the window of her green Mercury to talk for a moment, waiting for the outdoor pantry to open at 9 a.m.  “Life wasn’t always this way with us. My husband got hurt a few years ago and it changed our whole life,” said Owens, 77, a retired bookkeeper. “We were in the process of getting all of our ducks in a row for retirement and it just upside-downed everything, so food pantries have helped us through the situation.”  At Ozarks Food Harvest, seniors are the fastest growing segment of people who ask for food assistance, Brown said, citing their “fixed incomes and inflation.”  He is carefully watching the tax-and-spending debate in Congress, mindful that whatever the president ultimately signs into law will impact the lives of people in Springfield and across the southern Missouri region his organization serves with a mission statement of “transforming hunger into hope.”  “Anytime that there’s a change in federal benefits that results in a net loss, people have to meet that gap somewhere,” Brown said, walking through his cavernous warehouse. “They’re going to turn to food pantries and we’re stretched thin anyway.”  This story has been updated Monday with additional developments.

"Ukrainian drone attack on factory deep inside Russia kills three, wounds 35","The attack comes shortly after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promises to increase Ukraine’s drone production.  A Ukrainian drone attack at an industrial plant in central Russia has killed three people and injured 35 others, a Russian regional governor has said.  Alexander Brechalov, head of the Udmurt Republic, said in a post on Telegram on Tuesday that the attack took place at a factory in Izhevsk city. Ten of the wounded were in a serious condition, he noted.          There was no immediate official comment from Kyiv. But a Ukrainian security official confirmed the attack, telling the news agency Reuters that the Kupol plant had been hit, with a fire breaking out as a result.  The facility, which produces air defence systems and drones for the Russian army, is located roughly 1,300km (800 miles) from the Ukrainian border.  If confirmed, the Ukrainian mission would be one of the deepest attacks of its kind inside Russia since the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion.  However, it is not as far as one Kyiv claimed last May, which reportedly hit an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800km (1,120 miles) from Ukraine.  Speaking to the AFP news agency on Tuesday, an unnamed Ukrainian security service (SBU) official hailed the most recent drone mission.  “Each such special operation reduces the enemy’s offensive potential, disrupts military production chains and demonstrates that even deep in Russia’s rear, there are no safe zones for its military infrastructure,” they said in written comments.  The attack came a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would increase its drone production, following a surge in Russian drone attacks.  Moscow fired some 5,438 long-range drones at Ukraine in June, its highest monthly total yet, according to an analysis by AFP.  “The priority is drones, interceptor drones and long-range strike drones,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram late on Monday about Ukraine’s manufacturing drive.  The message followed a promise last month by Ukraine’s top military commander to improve the “scale and depth” of strikes on Russia.  In other developments, the Kremlin has denied the suggestion from one of United States President Donald Trump’s special envoys that it was deliberately stalling ceasefire talks.  Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, said on Monday, “Russia cannot continue to stall for time while it bombs civilian targets in Ukraine.”  In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed that Russia was “not interested in drawing out anything”.  A date for a third round of negotiations has yet to be agreed.  Meanwhile, a Russian-backed official in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk said it is now fully under the control of Moscow. Ukraine is yet to respond to the claim.

"Why is the US dollar falling by record levels in 2025?","Sell-off linked to unpredictable and unfunded economic policies which threaten the safe-haven role of the US dollar.  The United States dollar has had its worst first six months of the year since 1973, as President Donald Trump’s economic policies have prompted global investors to sell their greenback holdings, threatening the currency’s “safe-haven” status.  The dollar index, which measures the currency’s strength against a basket of six others, including the pound, euro and yen, fell 10.8 percent in the first half of 2025.  President Trump’s stop-start tariff war, and his attacks that have led to worries over the independence of the Federal Reserve, have undermined the appeal of the dollar as a safe bet. Economists are also worried about Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill, currently under debate in the US Congress.  The landmark legislation is expected to add trillions of dollars to the US debt pile over the coming decade and has raised concerns about the sustainability of Washington’s borrowing, prompting an exodus from the US Treasury market.  Meanwhile, gold has hit record highs this year, on continued buying by central banks worried about devaluation of their dollar assets.    On April 2, the Trump administration unveiled tariffs on imports from most countries around the world, denting confidence in the world’s largest economy and causing a selloff in US financial assets.  More than $5 trillion was erased from the value of the benchmark S&P 500 index of shares in the three days after “Liberation Day”, as Trump described the day of his tariffs announcement. US Treasuries also saw clear-outs, lowering their price and sending debt costs for the US government sharply higher.  Faced with a revolt in financial markets, Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, except for exports from China, on April 9. While trade tensions with China – the world’s second-largest economy – have since eased, investors remain wary of holding dollar-linked assets.  Last month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced that it had cut its US growth outlook for this year from 2.2 percent in March to just 1.6 percent, even as inflation has slowed.  Looking ahead, Republican leaders are trying to push through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act through Congress before July 4. The bill would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, slash healthcare and welfare spending and increase borrowing.  While some legislators believe it could take until August to pass the bill, the aim would be to raise the borrowing limit on the country’s $36.2 trillion debt pile. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said it would raise Federal debt by $3.3 trillion by 2034.  That would significantly raise the government’s debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio from 124 percent today, raising concerns about long-term debt sustainability. Meanwhile, annual deficits – when state spending exceeds tax revenues – would rise to 6.9 percent of GDP from about 6.4 percent in 2024.  So far, Trump’s attempts to lower spending through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have fallen short of expectations. And though import tariffs have raised revenue for the government, they’ve been paid for – in the form of higher costs – by American consumers.  The upshot is that Trump’s unpredictable policies, which prompted Moody’s rating agency to strip the US government of its top credit score in May, have slowed US growth prospects this year and dented the demand for its currency.  The dollar has also trended down on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support the United States’ economy, urged on by Trump, with two to three reductions expected by the end of this year, according to levels implied by futures contracts.  Owing to its dominance in trade and finance, the dollar has been the world’s currency anchor. In the 1980s, for instance, many Gulf countries began pegging their currencies to the greenback.  Its influence doesn’t stop there. Though the US accounts for one-quarter of global GDP, 54 percent of world exports were denominated in dollars in 2023, according to the Atlantic Council.  Its dominance in finance is even greater. About 60 percent of all bank deposits are denominated in dollars, while nearly 70 percent of international bonds are quoted in the US currency.  Meanwhile, 57 percent of the world’s foreign currency reserves – assets held by central banks – are held in dollars, according to the IMF.  But the dollar’s reserve status is supported by confidence in the US economy, its financial markets and its legal system.  And Trump is changing that. Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J Safra Sarasin, says “investors are beginning to realise that they’re over-exposed to US assets.”  Indeed, foreigners own $19 trillion of US equities, $7 trillion of US Treasuries and $5 trillion of US corporate bonds, according to Apollo Asset Management.  If investors continue to trim their positions, the dollar’s value could continue to come under sustained pressure.  “The US has become a less attractive place to invest these days… US assets are not as safe as they used to be,” Junius told Al Jazeera.  Many within the Trump administration argue that the costs of the US dollar’s reserve status outweigh the benefits – because that raises the cost of US exports.  Stephen Miran, chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, has said high dollar valuations place “undue burdens on our firms and workers, making their products and labour uncompetitive on the global stage”.  “The dollar’s overvaluation has been one factor contributing to the US’s loss of competitiveness over the years, and… tariffs are a reaction to this unpleasant reality,” he added.  At first blush, a lower dollar would indeed make US goods cheaper to overseas buyers and make imports more expensive, helping to reduce the country’s trade deficits. However, these typical trade effects remain in flux due to ongoing tariff threats.  For developing countries, a weaker greenback will lower the local currency cost of repaying dollar debt, providing relief to heavily indebted countries like Zambia, Ghana or Pakistan.  Elsewhere, a weaker dollar should boost commodity prices, increasing export revenues for countries exporting oil, metals or agricultural goods such as Indonesia, Nigeria and Chile.  Since the start of Trump’s second term in office, the greenback’s slide has upended widespread predictions that his trade war would do greater damage to economies outside the US, while also spurring US inflation – strengthening the currency against its rivals.  Instead, the euro has risen 13 percent to above $1.17 as investors continue to focus on growth risks inside the US. At the same time, demand has risen for other safe assets like German and French government bonds.  For American investors, the weaker dollar has also encouraged equity investments abroad. The Stoxx 600 index, a broad measure across European stocks, has risen roughly 15 percent since the start of 2025.  Converted back into dollars, that gain amounts to 23 percent.  Meanwhile, inflation – again belying predictions – has come down from 3 percent in January to 2.3 percent in May.  According to Junius, there is no significant threat to the dollar’s status as the world’s de facto reserve currency anytime soon.  But “that doesn’t mean that you can’t have more of a weakening in the US dollar,” he said. “In fact, we continue to expect that between now and the end of the year.”                    Follow Al Jazeera English:","https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/1/why-is-the-us-dollar-falling-by-record-levels-in-2025","Al Jazeera English","Tue Jul 01 13:38:00 EEST 2025","https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20132268592574621_20.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675"
"Health alerts, risk of field fires as heatwave sweeps across Europe","A record-breaking heatwave has forced many schools in France and the Netherlands to close amid health warnings.  A blistering early summer heatwave is making its way from the Iberian Peninsula northwards across Europe, forcing thousands of schools to close in France and prompting health warnings.  The Mediterranean Sea was warmer by up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) than usual for the time of year, hitting a record of as much as 30C (86F) in Spain’s Balearic Sea as a heat dome trapped hot air above Europe, the country’s weather forecaster Aemet said.  According to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent, experiencing a temperature increase twice the global average. This causes extreme heatwaves earlier in the year and persists into later months.  French forecaster Meteo-France said the heat in France was set to peak on Tuesday, reaching 40-41C (104-106F) in some areas and 36-39C (97-102F) in others.  The country had experienced its hottest June day on record on Monday.  Sixteen departments will be at the highest level of alert from noon, with 68 at the second-highest level.  The Education Ministry said some 1,350 schools will be fully or partially closed due to the heat, up significantly from about 200 on Monday. The top floor of the Eiffel Tower will be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, and visitors are advised to drink plenty of water.  The extreme heat also raised the risk of field fires as farmers in France, the European Union’s biggest grain producer, start harvesting this year’s crop.  Some farmers worked through the night to avoid harvesting during peak afternoon temperatures.  In the Indre region of central France, which has seen a spate of field fires since late June, authorities banned fieldwork between 2pm (12:00 GMT) and 6pm (16:00 GMT).  As far north as the Netherlands, some regions were placed on the second-highest alert on Tuesday, with temperatures forecast to reach 38C (100F).  In Amsterdam, extra measures were taken to protect the homeless, while officials in Eindhoven and Arnhem deployed teams to check in on vulnerable elderly people.  Schools in Rotterdam and across West Brabant have adopted “tropical schedules”, which involve shorter hours and additional water breaks for pupils to reduce heat exposure.  Health concerns  Health alerts have been issued across Europe, with residents and tourists alike seeking ways to keep cool.  According to insurance company Swiss Re, extreme heat kills up to 480,000 people annually around the world. This exceeds the combined death toll from floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes.  Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are a key cause of climate change, with deforestation and industrial practices being other contributing factors. Last year was the planet’s hottest on record.

"Charities urge shutdown of US- and Israel-backed Gaza aid group","‘This is not a humanitarian response,’ say 130 NGOs calling for UN to take over distribution of humanitarian aid.  More than 130 humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Amnesty International, have demanded the immediate closure of the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), accusing it of facilitating attacks on starving Palestinians.  In a joint statement released on Tuesday, the NGOs said Israeli forces and armed groups “routinely” open fire on civilians attempting to access food.  Since the GHF began operations in late May, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid, and nearly 4,000 wounded, the groups reported.  They condemned the aid mechanism as a violation of humanitarian norms, accusing it of funnelling Gaza’s 2.2 million residents into overcrowded, militarised distribution zones, where they are exposed to near-daily gunfire.  “Palestinians in Gaza face an impossible choice: starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families,” the statement said. “Orphaned children and caregivers are among the dead, with children harmed in over half of the attacks on civilians at these sites.”  Since its launch, the GHF has replaced more than 400 localised distribution points – which had functioned during a brief ceasefire – with only four centralised sites under Israeli military control: Three in Gaza’s southwest and one in the centre.  “Amidst severe hunger and famine-like conditions, many families tell us they are now too weak to compete for food rations,” the NGOs said, insisting that GHF “is not a humanitarian response”.  Speaking to Al Jazeera from Gaza City, Palestinian civil society leader Amjad Shawa said the aid mechanism is not providing sufficient supplies for hungry families, and also pressures people to move towards southern Gaza.  “They are delivering tiny portions of food – a few energy bars, some oil, rice, and flour – barely enough to last two or three days,” he said. “This isn’t a proper meal. It risks deepening malnutrition in Gaza.”  Shawa argued that positioning the GHF distribution points mainly in southern and eastern Gaza reflects a deliberate strategy to drive people out of the north, aligning with wider Israeli military objectives. “It’s a calculated effort to push Palestinians further south,” he said.  UN agencies and humanitarian leaders have repeatedly criticised the GHF model. Last week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres labelled it “inherently unsafe”.  Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported on Friday that Israeli soldiers had been ordered to shoot at unarmed Palestinians near aid sites to disperse them.  Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said there has been no letup in attacks on aid seekers, with the “Israeli military opening fire on hungry crowds trying to approach aid supplies from the GHF, killing at least 16” people on Tuesday. The aid seekers were among at least 44 people killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza on Tuesday, medical sources told Al Jazeera.  The condemnation comes as Israeli officials, including Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, arrive in Washington, DC for renewed ceasefire talks. Mediator Qatar confirmed ongoing efforts to revive negotiations, but noted that progress was slow.  “There’s a momentum created by the Iran-Israel ceasefire,” said Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari, “but the main obstacle is that both parties are not returning to the table.”  Israel’s military chief said last week that its ground operation was nearing its objectives, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed new opportunities had emerged to recover captives held by Palestinian groups – 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.  Meanwhile, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Monday that there had been no contact from Israel for weeks. “We are determined to seek a ceasefire that will save our people, and we are working with mediators to open the crossings,” he said.

"Why is Musk calling for a new America Party over the Big Beautiful Bill?","Elon Musk has threatened to form a new political party as the US Senate debates Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But can he actually do it?  Billionaire Elon Musk said on Monday that he would form a new political party in the United States if a Republican-leaning Congress passes President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”, which proposes tax breaks and funding cuts for healthcare and food programmes.  Musk has voiced criticism of the bill on multiple occasions over the past month and began suggesting the idea of the new party on social media starting early June.  Here is more on Musk’s reservations about the bill, and about his new proposed party.  Musk has been saying that if the bill is passed, Republicans are no different from Democrats, who are often accused by conservatives of being profligate with spending taxpayers’ dollars.  The version of the bill that the Senate is now discussing, if passed by both chambers of Congress, would expand the national debt by $3.3 trillion between 2025 and 2034. The current US national debt stands at more than $36 trillion.  “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,” Musk posted on his social media platform, X, on Monday.  “Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.”  In an earlier post, Musk wrote: “It is obvious with the insane spending of this bill, which increases the debt ceiling by a record FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS that we live in a one-party country – the PORKY PIG PARTY!!”  The debt ceiling, set by the US Congress, determines the upper limit of the amount that the US Treasury can borrow. The current debt limit is $36.1 trillion.  Once a key aide and major campaign donor for Trump, Musk had a public online falling out with the president in June over his criticism of the bill.  On June 3, Musk wrote on X: “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.”  Musk alleged that Trump was linked to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in a now-deleted post on X. However, Trump and Musk seemed to have reached a detente when Trump told reporters that he wished Musk well while the latter wrote on X on June 11 that he had gone “too far” in his criticism of the US president.  However, since then, Musk has argued in a series of online posts that the bill would increase the debt ceiling, “bankrupt America”, and “destroy millions of jobs in America”.  Musk owns the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla. The current version of the bill, with amendments made by the Senate, seeks to end the tax credit worth up to $7,500 for purchases of EVs, starting on September 30. This could reduce the consumer demand for EVs in the US.  On June 5, Musk posted a poll on his X account, asking his followers: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80 percent in the middle?”  While social media polls are known to be nonrepresentative of broader public sentiment, 5.6 million people voted on the poll, and 80.4 percent responded with “yes”. Since then, Musk has repeatedly reposted the poll result, citing it as evidence that most Americans want a new party to be formed.  “Musk believes that 80 percent of Americans are unhappy with the two major parties and are not being represented,” Natasha Lindstaedt, a professor at the Department of Government, the University of Essex, told Al Jazeera.  While that number might not reflect the wider American public, it does point to a trend in the electorate; according to a Gallup poll from 2024, 43 percent of Americans identified as independent, 28 percent identified as Republican and 28 percent identified as Democrat. In other words, more Americans identify as independent than as either Democrat or Republican.  One of Musk’s followers replied to a post on X with an image with the text “America Party”. The world’s richest man responded: “‘America Party’ has a nice ring to it. The party that actually represents America!”  Experts say Musk, whose net worth is $363bn as of Monday according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, would realistically be able to fund a third party in the US. However, it is still unclear whether he would go ahead with his plan or whether his party would have a significant effect on US elections.  “Musk certainly has the financial power to back a third party that could be very disruptive to the Republican Party, but it’s not certain if Musk will take on this risk,” Lindstaedt said.  Lindstaedt recalled how earlier this month, Musk backed down from his criticism of Trump on X. “If we take him at his word, he could spend hundreds of millions on this project,” she added.  “Musk has been ramping up his criticism of the bill lately, and he may find specific legislators [particularly from the House] would be willing to defect if their constituencies are more negatively affected by Trump’s policies,” Lindstaedt said, referring to the House of Representatives. “He will also have the attention of fiscal hawks in particular.”  Lindstaedt added that among American voters, there is a “huge appetite” for a third party.  “The bill will leave the US spending hundreds of billions just in interest, and the more Americans understand this, the more they may want to flock to something different. US public frustration with the traditional parties is at an all-time high, and Musk may be able to capitalise on this.”  However, Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science in the UCL School of Public Policy in London, said it was unclear whether Musk was serious and suggested that the barriers to breaking the Republican-Democrat duopoly are hard to scale for anyone.  “This is Elon Musk bluffing,” he told Al Jazeera. “He knows as well as anyone that the power of party machines behind Democrats and Republicans is too much to surmount.”  Gift added that while forming a party is possible, “winning seats in Congress or the White House is another matter entirely”.  “At best, a third party will have little impact on US elections; at worst, it will play ‘spoiler’, taking votes from one of the two parties and de facto giving it to another.”  Paul Levinson, professor of communication and media studies at Fordham University, New York, said that historically, third parties in the US have had a poor record.  “Given the poor record that third parties have had in the US – even when a former president, Theodore Roosevelt, launched one, the Bull Moose Party aka the Progressive Party in 1912 – Musk’s proposed ‘American Party’ is not likely to have much success.”  Roosevelt formed the Progressive Party after he lost the nomination of the Republican Party for the 1912 presidential election to Howard Taft. But while the new party dramatically pulled away votes from the Republican Party in the election, and Roosevelt won 88 Electoral votes – and more than four million votes in all – he finished far behind the winner, Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who won 435 Electoral College votes. In 2016, Roosevelt backed the Republican Party nominee, Charles Evan Hughes, and in 2020, the Progressive Party dissolved.  On Monday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, saying: “Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.”  Trump added: “Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.”  “Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!” Trump wrote, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory body aimed at boosting government efficiency and upgrading information technology, that Musk formed and led at the start of Trump’s second administration, before leaving on May 30.

"Israel has killed 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, 2023","Since Israel began its genocidal war on Gaza, it has also killed 1,000 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.  Since October 7, 2023, Israel has escalated its violence in the occupied West Bank, killing 1,000 Palestinians.  As the world was distracted by Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 56,331 people and uprooted nearly the entire population of 2.3 million, Israel ramped up its violent raids on the West Bank, as well as its silence as Israeli settlers attack and kill Palestinian villagers.  The most recent casualty was Samer Bassam al-Zagharneh, a young man who was shot by Israeli soldiers on July 1.  According to the Wafa Palestinian news agency, al-Zagharneh was killed near the separation barrier, which Israel began building in 2002 to divide Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank and which cuts through Palestinian communities and agricultural fields.  This is all you need to know about how we got here.  Israeli forces and Israeli settlers from illegal settlements that are choking the West Bank.  Settlers launch sudden, violent raids on towns, burning property, attacking people, and trying to drive them out of their homes.  At the same time, the security forces have surrounded refugee camps and raided them relentlessly, driving yet more people from their homes and not allowing them to return.  Many settlers have also been handed semi-automatic weapons and “integrated” into Israeli forces in the West Bank, to compensate for all the personnel deployed to carry out the war on Gaza.  This has blurred the lines between the security forces and settlers, empowering the latter to escalate violence against Palestinians.  To displace Palestinians and annexe their land, according to residents, experts, rights groups, and observers.  In 2024, Israel confiscated more Palestinian land in the West Bank than in the previous 20 years combined, according to Peace Now, an Israeli nonprofit tracking land theft in Palestine.  Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has led the charge after assuming control of the newly established “Settlements Administration” in February 2023.  The position allows Smotrich to advance Israel’s de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank by working to extend Israeli civil law over the area, in direct contravention of international law.  Smotrich has approved new outposts – illegal not only under international law but also under Israeli law – confiscated land, and enforced “settlement and construction regulations”.  In reality, Smotrich is relying on the occupation and settler violence to uproot Palestinians so that he can extend and approve new illegal Israeli settlements, Al Jazeera previously reported.        Every day.  Israeli forces killed 70 Palestinians in the West Bank in the first month of 2025. Over the last two months, they have killed 34 people, according to the Shireen Monitor, a local observatory named after the murdered Palestinian Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.  Many of the casualties were the result of Israel’s ongoing raids.  Israel says the raids are to root out Palestinian armed groups, which sprang up in 2021 to resist Israel’s worsening violence and entrenching occupation, in refugee camps across the West Bank.  However, Israel has reportedly committed myriad human rights abuses on the ground, such as killing unarmed civilians, preventing families from burying their murdered loved ones and razing entire neighbourhoods to the ground to trigger mass displacement.  Israel is attacking the refugee camps in Jenin, Tulkarem, Nur Shams, Far’a and Nablus, generating mass displacement.  Israel has used some of the same tactics it has deployed in Gaza – such as laying complete siege to the camps and uprooting most of the inhabitants, according to Forensic Architecture, a research group that investigates and monitors human rights abuses.  Israel has also attacked medical facilities and bombed Tulkarem and Jenin camps, indiscriminately killing civilians.        There were about 1,800 settler attacks across the occupied West Bank between October 7, 2023, and December 16, 2024, according to data collected by Tech for Palestine, a collective of tech volunteers that monitor rights abuses and advocates for the liberation of Palestinians.  What’s more, the Israeli army reported that there were at least 414 settler attacks against Palestinians during the first half of 2025. Yet the real figure is likely higher.  Many of the attacks have taken place in Area C.  The 1993 Oslo Accords, which were signed between Israeli and Palestinian then-leaders to initiate a peace process, carved up the occupied West Bank into three zones: A, B and C.  Area A is ostensibly under the full administrative and security control of the Palestinian Authority (PA) – an entity born out of the Oslo Accords – while Area B is under the PA’s administrative governance and Israeli security.  Area C makes up more than 60 percent of the occupied West Bank and is under Israeli administrative and security control.  It doesn’t look like it.  The Israeli army and settlers have stepped up attacks against Palestinians in recent days. The United Nations has warned that the army is trying to evict 12 communities in Masafer Yatta, in the southern Hebron hills in Area C.  Israel is trying to justify this expulsion as the area being a “military zone”, and, therefore, needed for military training – a pretext used to uproot Palestinians from their lands for decades.  On June 25, about 100 heavily armed Israeli settlers violently attacked Palestinians in the village of Kfar Malik, killing three people. The settlers were reportedly trying to burn homes to the ground when Palestinians came out to try and stop them.  In the neighbouring village of Taybeh, settlers burned a car to ashes, as seen in a video obtained by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group monitoring abuses against Palestinians.  Al Jazeera has spoken to several Palestinians who say they are bracing for more attacks.  They often say they are defenceless and fear any resistance will be met with greater force from Israeli troops and settlers.

"Why are ties between Azerbaijan and Russia fraying?","After ethnic Azeri suspects died during apparently violent raids in a Russian city, Baku has lashed out at Moscow.  In 2001, a man was stabbed to death near a lakeside restaurant in Yekaterinburg, an urban centre in Russia’s Ural Mountains region.  With his dying breath, he whispered the names of his alleged killers to the police, local media claimed.          The man and his presumed murderers were ethnic Azeris, Turkic-speaking Muslims whose families fled to Russia in the 1990s after the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azeri region dominated by ethnic Armenians.  But it took Russian authorities 24 years to identify and detain the presumed suspects – even though they ran the restaurant and never went into hiding.  Two alleged suspects died while being rounded up on Friday. One suffered a “heart attack” while the other suspect’s cause of death “is being established”, according to Russian prosecutors.  They also purported that the suspects were part of “a criminal group” allegedly involved in other murders and the sale of counterfeit alcohol that killed 44 people in 2021.  The prosecutors provided no answers as to why the presumed “criminals” were at large for so long – and did not elaborate on the apparently brutal manner in which they were detained.  The deaths triggered a diplomatic storm that may contribute to a tectonic shift in the strategic South Caucasus region, Russia’s former stamping ground, where Azerbaijan won Nagorno-Karabakh back in 2020, and Turkiye is regaining its centuries-old clout.  The spat has so far resulted in the arrest of two Russian intelligence officers in Azerbaijan, the shutdown of a Kremlin-funded media outlet there, and the cancellation of “cultural events” sponsored by Moscow.  Russian police and intelligence officers used “unacceptable violence” that killed two brothers, Ziyaddin Safarov and Gusein Safarov, and left their relatives severely injured, Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.  One of the injured men reportedly said masked officers began breaking his front door at dawn, frightening his children.  The officers “turned the house upside down and kept beating us for an hour without asking anything”, Mohammed Safarov told the MediaAzNews website.  He said his elderly father was also beaten and electrocuted for hours and claimed they were both requested to “volunteer” to fight Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Other Azeri media outlets published photos of bruises and wounds the men claimed were caused by Russian officers.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, in response to a question about Azerbaijan’s reactions, “We sincerely regret such decisions”.  He added, “We believe that everything that’s happening (in Yekaterinburg) is related to the work of law enforcement agencies, and this cannot and should not be a reason for such a reaction.”  But Emil Mustafayev, a political analyst based in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, said the incident highlighted a xenophobic strain in Russia.  “The killing of Azeris is a link in the chain of tendentious politics where ethnic minorities are used as a lightning rod,” he said. “This is not just a tragedy, this is a symptom of a deep sickness of the Russian society.”  The Azeri diaspora in Russia is at least two million strong, but they face discrimination, police brutality and hate attacks.  “The Kremlin has long ago mastered a trick – when domestic dissent is on the rise, there is a need to switch attention to ‘the enemies from within’, be that Ukrainians, Tajiks, Uzbeks or, like now, Azeris,” Mustafayev added.  The Kremlin uses state propaganda, police brutality and the taciturn approval of top officials to create an atmosphere of violence against migrants that is “seen as normal, as inevitable”, he said.  Back in the 1990s, Azeri migrants nearly monopolised fruit trade and mini-bus transportation in Russian urban centres.  Many still run countless shops selling vegetables and flowers.  “We are the boogeymen, cops always need to check our documents and need no excuse to harass us and call us names even after they see my Russian passport,” an ethnic Azeri owner of a flower shop near a major railway station in Moscow told Al Jazeera, on condition of anonymity.  Until the early 2000s, the Azeris “undoubtedly were the number one” most-hated ethnic minority in Russia, until the arrival of labour migrants from Russia’s North Caucasus and ex-Soviet Central Asia, said Nikolay Mitrokhin, a researcher with Germany’s Bremen University.  Since then, some ultra-nationalists and skinheads who considered Azeris their main enemies joined law enforcement agencies, he added.  “So, the cruelty in Yekaterinburg may have been caused by” the decades-old hatred, Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.  Other geopolitical factors contributed to anti-Azeri sentiments in Russia.  In 2020, Azerbaijan put an end to the seemingly unsolvable political deadlock over Nagorno-Karabakh.  “The success undoubtedly became possible thanks to Turkiye’s military aid,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London, told Al Jazeera.  Baku bought advanced Turkish-made Bayraktar drones that could easily strike large groups of Armenian and separatist soldiers, together with their trenches, tanks and trucks.  An Azeri-Turkish alliance emerged, “allowing Baku to get rid of Moscow’s obtrusive ‘peacekeeping’ mission and depriving it of a chance to manipulate the Azeri-Armenian conflict to keep both [Azerbaijan and Armenia] in its political orbit”, he said.  The alliance tarnished Moscow’s clout in South Caucasus, while Baku sympathised with Kyiv in the Russian-Ukrainian war, he said.  Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev also accused Russia of obstructing an investigation into the downing of an Azeri passenger plane over Chechnya last December.  The plane was apparently hit by panicking Russian air defence forces during a Ukrainian drone attack on Grozny, Chechnya’s administrative capital.  Aliyev also refused to take part in the May 9 parade on Moscow’s iconic Red Square to commemorate Russia’s role in defeating Nazi Germany in 1945.  Baku fiercely resists the Kremlin’s campaign to forcibly enlist Azeri labour migrants to join Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.  Ilkhamov said the violent sting in Yekaterinburg became part of the Kremlin’s efforts to “frighten the Azeri community in Russia”.

"Will Syria normalise relations with Israel?","Normalisation might be a step too far, but a return to a peace deal may be in sight.  After nearly 14 years of war in Syria, the new government is resetting its regional relations, and a lot of focus is on what will happen with Israel.  There are reports of talks between Syria and Israel, with timelines even being floated for potential normalisation between the two countries, which have technically been at war since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  Here’s what you need to know about possible normalisation between Syria and Israel:  Syria and Israel have held direct talks, according to Israeli media, about potentially entering into a normalisation agreement.  Communication between the two states has reportedly been facilitated by the United Arab Emirates, which established a backchannel for contact.  Any agreement would likely be an extension of the Abraham Accords, an agreement brokered by the United States between some Arab states and Israel.  The Abraham Accords were a top-down approach by Donald Trump during his first term as US president to get Arab states to formalise relations with Israel.  They were signed in August and September 2020 by the UAE and Bahrain, and soon followed by Sudan and Morocco.  Since then, Trump has worked to expand the accords by pushing more countries to sign agreements with Israel.  Trump visited three countries in the Middle East in May, and, while in Saudi Arabia, he met Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and reportedly encouraged him to normalise relations with Israel.        Possibly down the road, analysts say, but right now it would be nearly impossible, according to Syrian writer and author Robin Yassin-Kassab.  There is a deep enmity between Syria and Israel, which heightened during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and Israel’s occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights.  Israeli Defence Minister Gideon Saar said his country would insist on its occupation of the Golan Heights in any deal with Syria, and the Israeli army has gone deeper into the Golan, occupying homes and expelling people from the area.  Many Syrians would oppose giving up the Golan to Israel, according to analysts. Still, many might welcome common-sense negotiations.  “Syrians are split … because on the one hand people are exhausted, everyone recognises Syria cannot defend itself or fight Israel … so it’s good [al-Sharaa’s] negotiating,” Yassin-Kassab said, adding that a return to an agreement like the 1974 ceasefire is the most realistic option.  About a week after then-President Bashar al-Assad fled Syria in December 2024, Israel’s parliament voted on a plan to expand settlements in Syria – illegal under international law. There are currently more than 31,000 Israeli settlers in the occupied Golan Heights.  Syria, under al-Sharaa, has said it is open to peace with Israel and that it would uphold a 1974 ceasefire agreement between the two states, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on December 8 – the day al-Assad fled to Moscow – that he viewed the agreement as void.  Israel attacked Syria repeatedly, destroying much of its military infrastructure and seizing Syrian territory near the border with Syria’s Golan Heights.  Syria would likely ask for Israel to withdraw from the newly occupied area under a new non-aggression deal, though reports say the Golan Heights have not yet been discussed.  In recent days, Israeli officials have said they are open to a deal with Syria, and Netanyahu reportedly asked US Special Envoy Tom Barrack to help negotiate one.  Israel’s National Security Council head, Tzachi Hanegbi, has reportedly been overseeing discussions with Syrian officials. The talks include a US presence and are in “advanced stages”, according to senior Israeli officials who spoke to The Times of Israel.  Figures close to al-Sharaa are reportedly asking for an end to Israeli aggression without Syria having to accept full normalisation, Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar reported.        Syria wants the Israeli attacks on Syrian territory to cease.  There are concerns over Israel’s expanded occupation of the Golan Heights among many Syrians; however, it’s unclear if al-Sharaa’s government will demand the return of the occupied parts.  Syria would, however, want Israel to pull out of the Golan proper and the parts it occupied over the last year.  Israel also threatened the new Syrian government not to deploy soldiers south of Damascus, a region near its border with Israel.  Israel has also tried to stoke sectarianism in this area, threatening to intervene to “protect the Syrian Druze” during sectarian-driven tensions between groups affiliated with the new Syrian government and Syria’s minority Druze community.  While many in the Druze community have shown a distrust of Syria’s new government, many have also denounced Israel’s threats of intervention as a calculated stunt to cause further discord among Syrians.        Netanyahu reportedly wants a security agreement – an update on the 1974 text – with a framework towards a total peace plan with Syria.  US envoy Barrack claims the issue between Syria and Israel is “solvable” and has suggested they begin with a “non-aggression agreement”, according to Axios.  Such a continued occupation of the Golan would likely upset many Syrians.  “It’s too politically difficult [for al-Sharaa], even under American pressure and the continued threat of violence from Israel,” Yassin-Kassab said.  Israel also reportedly has additional conditions: no Turkish military bases in Syria, no presence of Iran or Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah, and the demilitarisation of southern Syria.

"Trans troops in US military 'in survival mode' as ban on serving kicks in","Kara joined the Army in 2008 and transitioned 10 years later  After 17 years in the US Army, Maj Kara Corcoran, 39, was preparing to graduate from an elite military leadership programme.  But there was a complication.  Two days before the ceremony, Kara was told that she would need to conform to male regulations, which meant wearing male uniform and cutting the long blonde hair she had grown since she told the Army she identified as a woman in 2018.  The directive had come from the Pentagon, and filtered down through her chain of command at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  'Nothing about me is a man, but we're going to force me into male regs just so I can walk across the stage with my peers,' she said in the hours leading up to the ceremony. 'It's not my choice to cut my hair. I'm doing it because I have to.'  Kara is one of several thousand transgender people affected by a ban, announced by US President Donald Trump in January, that prevents them from serving in any job in the US military.  A previous ban in his first term focused on new recruits and allowed some exceptions, particularly for those already serving. The 2025 policy removes virtually all of the exceptions.  Official figures say there are about 4,200 transgender service members in the US armed forces, however other estimates are much higher, at about 10,000.  Kara had her hair cut on 21 May, the day before her graduation ceremony  The new policy states that a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria - where a person feels their gender differs from their sex registered at birth - is 'incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service'.  An executive order outlined Trump's position that 'the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology' and that the policy would ensure staff were 'free of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalisation'.  The order also stated that 'a man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honour this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member'.  A Gallup poll, external in February this year suggested that 58% of Americans 'favour allowing openly transgender men and women to serve in the US military, but support has declined from 71% in 2019 and 66% in 2021'.  Critics have called the ban discriminatory and legal challenges have been filed from serving transgender officers and human rights groups.  Since February, the BBC has followed the lives of Maj Kara Corcoran and an officer in the Navy, Lt Rae Timberlake, as they navigate the uncertainty of their military careers. They have shared their thoughts and feelings in a personal capacity, not as spokespeople for the US military or other colleagues.  Kara during rifle practice near her base at Leavenworth, Kansas  Kara has spent most of her adult life in the US Army. Her combat deployments included time in Afghanistan where she was both a platoon leader and a company commander, when she was living as a man, before she transitioned. Since then, she says she has legally changed her name and gender and uses female pronouns.  Transgender people were disqualified from all jobs in the military until 2016, but over the past decade, as governments have changed, US policy has flip-flopped.  2016: Obama lifts ban on trans people serving, allowing them access to funding through the military for gender-related treatment  2017: Trump announces ban on trans people serving, citing medical costs and potential disruptions  2021: Biden signs order restoring the right of trans people to serve  2025: Trump announces new ban and bases are told to initiate separation proceedings against personnel with gender dysphoria  'For a long time, I stayed silent,' says Kara. When she joined up in 2008, women were not allowed in combat positions either.  Kara married a woman and had children, although the relationship broke down and ended as she grappled with her identity.  Kara came out as a transgender woman in 2018 and began her hormonal and surgical transition. She says she had the support of her commanding officers, who were still working to the previous set of guidelines, despite Trump's 2017 ban. She tells the BBC that the transition improved her ability to serve.  'It's made me more focused, more resilient,' she says. 'There's a common misconception that transitioning is a liability. For me, it's been the opposite.'  President Trump salutes during the US Army's 250th birthday parade, Washington DC, 14 June  Now, with Trump's latest policy in effect, Kara has been told that unless she leaves voluntarily, she may be forced out of the service against her will through a process called involuntary separation.  Involuntary separation happens when someone is discharged and they do not choose to leave of their own accord. It can affect any service member, not just people in combat roles.  As well as losing their jobs, people can also potentially lose benefits, such as pensions, healthcare and disability provisions.  The Department of Defense said that if someone went involuntarily they may get half what they would get if they left voluntarily - the difference could be tens of thousands of dollars.  Despite this, Maj Kara Corcoran says she does not want to walk away.  'I'm not going to get voluntarily separated,' she says. 'I'll go through the involuntary separation and what that looks like and how horrific they want to make that for me and other service members.'  Former US Navy Seal, Carl Higbie, believes trans people are not fit to serve in the armed services  Others such as former US Navy Seal, Carl Higbie, support Trump's ban, though. Carl now hosts a TV show on the conservative network Newsmax.  He believes that transgender people are not fit for service in the US military, arguing that gender dysphoria may require ongoing medical care and accommodations that could affect deployability.  'You can't take Ritalin [which is used to treat ADHD] or certain types of prescription medications and be an eligible service member in combat. Why should you be on hormone therapy, which we know has sometimes emotional effects?' he asks.  When asked if he thought that biological women, who may be on other medications containing hormones, such as treatment for the menopause, are fit to serve in the armed forces, he said: 'I think there are certain times where we should be more concerned about killing bad guys than making sure that we have gender quotas on a combat operation.'  Listen to Inside the US trans military ban on BBC Sounds  The ban on transgender service members is part of a broader shift in US military policy - Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a Trump appointee and former army officer, has moved to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programmes.  'I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is 'our diversity is our strength',' Hegseth said at a Pentagon event in February.  And in April, he posted on X that he 'proudly ended' the Women, Peace and Security programme, an initiative to invite more women and girls to be part of conflict resolution. He called it a distraction from the core task of 'war-fighting'.  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the ban was 'the president's agenda... and we're going to continue to relentlessly pursue it'  Many had seen the policy shift coming. In the early hours of 6 November, when Trump secured his victory in the 2024 US presidential election, Lt Rae Timberlake made a decision.  A non-binary navy officer, Rae joined the Navy aged 17 and has served aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and in the Middle East.  Rae falls under the trans umbrella because, although they were registered female at birth, they identify as neither male nor female and use they/them pronouns.  Rae says that coming out as non-binary in 2020 and transitioning brought clarity to their identity. 'The moment I heard the word 'non-binary', I knew it fit,' they told the BBC.  But with the 2024 Trump victory, Rae felt the clock was ticking on their career. They requested to transfer from their West Coast base, to a base closer to family in the east, who could give them support.  Rae Timberlake has spent half their life - 17 years - in the US Navy  Rae, their wife and daughter moved in the middle of a school term, in the anticipation that a possible separation from the Navy was imminent.  'It felt like the safest move for us, in case I was forced to leave the service,' says Rae.  They add that they weren't surprised by Trump's executive order in January, or a memorandum from the Department of Defense the following month.  The memo specified that military bases must identify service members diagnosed with or exhibiting symptoms of gender dysphoria. The final deadlines to come forward voluntarily were eventually set as 6 June for active-duty personnel and 7 July for reserve and National Guard members.  In May, the Department of Defense said 1,000 service personnel had self-identified as trans, but there has been no update of the number since then.  The military has 30 days from a deadline to start involuntary separation proceedings.  The memo, external includes a provision for people to be considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis. There are a few conditions including that staff must have 'never attempted to transition to any sex other than their sex'.  Rae and their wife Lindsay are now settling in to their new home on the East Coast  By the time the memorandum was published, Rae had taken a new post in Maryland, and the family was adjusting to their new home.  'Watching Rae lose their career, it's painful,' their wife, Lindsay, says. 'We're in survival mode. We haven't had time to connect as a family. We just keep making hard choices.'  For Rae, the emotional cost has been high. They have decided they want more control over the future, so have requested to retire from the Navy, and believe that in doing so have self-identified for voluntary separation. The application hasn't been accepted yet, but Rae believes it will be.  They expect the financial implications to be substantial. Without completing 20 years of service, Rae says they will likely forfeit eligibility for a military pension. They estimate pension payments could have added up to about $2.5m (£1.8m) over the course of their retirement.  While the Department of Defense says the ban will maintain consistent medical and readiness standards across the forces, opponents argue that the policy targets a vulnerable group unfairly.  Three lawsuits have been filed challenging its legality.  In one high-profile ruling, a federal judge blocked the ban temporarily, citing concerns over its constitutionality and suggesting it discriminated based on gender identity. However, in April, the Supreme Court lifted the injunction, allowing the policy to move forward while litigation continues.  The legal back-and-forth has left transgender service members in limbo.  Rae says they want to be accepted for who they are  Rae has found job hunting in the civilian sector tough. 'I applied for a position that had over 800 applicants in one day,' they say, adding that civilian life will offer less security than the Navy. 'It's competitive and daunting out there.'  But they say the next chapter is about not feeling 'under threat for who I am'.  Kara didn't self-identify by the 6 June deadline, so is waiting to see if the military flags her for separation - the 30-day window means that should happen by 6 July. She will see what unfolds from there.  The US Department of Defense declined to give a statement to the BBC but pointed to previous statements saying it was committed to treating all service members impacted by the policy with dignity and respect. A US defence official said that 'characterisation of service will be honourable except where the service member's record otherwise warrants a lower characterisation'.  For now Kara remains at her base in Fort Leavenworth but is prepared to leave with little notice if she has to. She has turned her car into a mobile home with a chunky power bank, cooking equipment, and a fold-out mattress. 'On top I've got an eight-gallon water tank. I fill it up, pump it with an air compressor, and I can take a shower out in the wild. At least I have somewhere to live.'  When she graduated from the leadership programme with distinction, after complying with male uniform and grooming standards, she said it 'meant a lot, but how I had to do it felt like erasing my identity'.  'This is about people who've dedicated their lives to service, now being told they're no longer fit, not because of performance, but because of who they are.'

"Senate Republicans struggle to push Trump's budget bill over the finish line","This video can not be played  Watch: Trump’s 'big, beautiful bill' triggers Senate face-off  US Senators have spent more than 24 hours negotiating amendments to a mega-bill on tax and spending that appears to have stalled without enough votes to pass.  Four Republicans in the Senate have said they cannot support the nearly 1,000 page legislation as it stands, but with a slim margin of control the party needs to win over only one senator.  Once the bill passes the Senate, it will need to return to the House of Representatives where it faces another tough battle as Republicans control the chamber by only a few votes.  While President Donald Trump previously told Congress he wanted the legislation on his desk by 4 July, on Tuesday he conceded it would be 'very hard' to meet that deadline.  JD Vance arrived at the Capitol at dawn and will likely play a key role in the fate of Trump's bill  By mid-morning on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune was pacing up and down the centre aisle of the Senate floor, alone, arms crossed, chewing gum.  The bill's ultimate success, or failure, largely falls on his shoulders. Republican leadership appeared increasingly confident of having the numbers to pass it, and indicated final votes would take place late on Tuesday morning.  Republicans appear to have, for now, lost the support of four Republicans: Maine's Susan Collins, North Carolina's Thom Tillis, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Kentucky's Rand Paul.  As they can only have three defectors, Vice-President JD Vance arrived on Capitol Hill just after 6:00 EST (12:00 GMT) to cast tie-breaking votes.  He helped push one amendment over a tight margin, and is expected to play a key role in the bill's fate.  The amendments process is wrapping up and Republican Senate leadership are conversing and negotiating with their dissenters to get the necessary number of votes. Leadership will not bring the bill to a final vote until they have the numbers they need. It's unclear when that could happen.  The bill - essential to Trump's second-term agenda - would extend large tax cuts the president put in place during his first term.  To make up for that loss of revenue, Republicans want to cut spending from a variety of programmes, including healthcare for lower-income Americans and food subsidies. But within the Senate, Republicans disagree on where those cuts should come from.  Trump previously requested that the Republican-controlled Congress send him a final version of the bill to sign into law by Friday.  A look at the key items in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'  But following more than 24 hours of debate over amendments to the bill, called a vote-a-rama, which underscores clear divisions over the bill, he softened his tone on the 4 July deadline.  'I'd love to do July 4th but I think it's very hard to do July 4th…. I would say maybe July 4th or somewhere around there,' Trump told reporters as he was departing the White House.  In May, the House of Representatives passed their version of a budget bill by a one-vote margin. When the legislation arrived in the Senate, Republicans made numerous changes to it.  So when the bill does pass the Senate, it will need to go back to the House of Representatives for another vote, where Republicans are expected another uphill battle.  Democrats in both chambers do not support the bill and in the Senate they have attempted to throw some obstacles in the way of its passage.

"M&S 'fully back online in four weeks', says boss","Online shopping at Marks & Spencer is expected to be 'fully on' within four weeks as it recovers from a cyber attack, the retailer's boss has said.  Although M&S restarted internet orders in June, half of its online operations - including click and collect - are still down, Stuart Machin told the retailer's annual general meeting (AGM).  M&S will then focus on getting its Castle Donington distribution centre 'back and running', Mr Machin said.  The retailer hopes that by August 'we will have the vast majority of this behind us', he said.  Inside the High Street Cyber-Attacks  Who hacked M&S and Co-op? We go inside the cyber-attacks that shook the British high street and speak directly with the hackers and learn what data they've stolen.  The cyber attack in April locked up M&S systems, hitting sales for about six weeks, and the hackers also stole some customer data.  The attack, which disrupted M&S online shopping and left some shelves bare in stores, will hit this year's profits by around £300m, the retailer has estimated.  This would only partly be covered by any insurance payout.  Although online orders have restarted in England, Scotland and Wales, customers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are still waiting for the service to resume.  'Currently, half of online is open but not areas like click and collect. Within the next four weeks we are hoping for the whole of online to be fully on,' Mr Machin told shareholders at the AGM.  'Then our focus will be getting the Donington site back and running.'  M&S had previously said services would continue to be disrupted in June and July.  The retailer sent out e-gift cards last week to customers who had online orders cancelled or had click and collect orders delayed.  What can I buy online at M&S since the hack?  M&S restarts online orders after cyber attack  There are some signs that the disruption helped some of the retailer's rivals.  Supermarket chain Sainsbury's said on Tuesday that it had seen 'a little bit of benefit' from stock being down in M&S stores due to the attack.  'It stands to reason. If a particular store is lower on stock in the moment, a customer will go somewhere nearby,' said chief executive Simon Roberts.  Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that although the retailer had strength, 'there's still a lot to get back online before the company can put the cyber attack behind it'.  There are early signs of 'pent-up demand', for its summer fashion styles, 'with many of the popular products sold out online'.  She added that its strong set of annual results showed the retailer was 'in a resilient position' before the attack, which 'bodes well for M&S ahead'.

"Boy who was 15 when he killed Alness father-of-two is jailed","Scott Mitchell was a keen runner and cyclist who had raised money for charities  A teenager who killed a father-of-two in an attack in the Highlands has been jailed for six-and-a-half years.  The boy, who was 15 at the time, punched and kicked Scott Mitchell, 48, in a back garden in Alness on 17 June 2023.  The High Court in Glasgow heard the teenager had an 'anger problem' and mistakenly believed Mr Mitchell was sexually assaulting a woman.  Judge Lord Arthurson described the killing as 'savage and merciless'.  The teenager, who cannot be identified because of his age, admitted to the culpable homicide of Mr Mitchell during a hearing in Inverness last month.  More stories from the Highlands and Islands  News from the Highlands and Islands on BBC Sounds  The court previously heard how Mr Mitchell, who had split from his wife, met a woman in Alness' Station Bar.  They later went to a house where the teenager saw Mr Mitchell kissing the woman in the back garden.  The boy had been drinking at a friend's house and was walking home at about midnight.  A neighbour heard the teenager's screams of anger and shouted at him to leave Mr Mitchell alone, but the attack continued.  Mr Mitchell, a keen runner and cyclist who had raised thousands for local charities, died after suffering injuries to his face.  Police found the teenager soaked in blood in a nearby park. He later told officers he had an anger problem.  He had originally faced a murder allegation before prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to the reduced charge.  Donald Findlay KC, defending, told the High Court in Glasgow the teenager had 'misread' the situation between Mr Mitchell and the woman with 'appalling consequences'.  The advocate added that the boy was now 'absolutely distraught' at what he had done.  Sentencing him, Lord Arthurson said: 'This was a savage, sustained and merciless case of sheer brutality.  'You punched and kicked your victim to death.  'You battered his face to a pulp while you were, as you later stated, out of control with anger.'  The judge said Mr Mitchell died a terrible, violent and lonely death.  The court heard that the BT engineer had lived with his mother, and that she died on the first anniversary of her son's death.  Lord Arthurson said he had been a respected member of his community, and would be 'deeply missed' by his family.  The judge told the teenager: 'One day you will complete your sentence and return home to resume your life - that prospect has been wholly denied for Mr Mitchell and his grieving family entirely due to your appalling behaviour.'

"Bella Culley tells court she was tortured into smuggling drugs","Bella Culley's family is being supported by the Foreign Office  A British teenager held in prison in Georgia was 'tortured' into smuggling drugs, she told a pre-trial hearing as she was refused bail.  Bella Culley, 19, from Billingham, Teesside, appeared at Tbilisi City Court and pleaded not guilty to charges of possession and trafficking a large amount of illegal drugs.  Mr Malkhaz Salakaia, representing Miss Culley, said she had been threatened with a hot iron to coerce her into travelling with the suitcase filled with drugs.  Miss Culley stood in front of the judge in the courtroom and showed her right wrist which had a scar on it.  Speaking in court, the 19-year-old said: 'I did not want to do this. I was forced to do this through torture.  'I just wanted to travel. I am a good person. I am a student at university. I am a clean person. I don't do drugs.'  Miss Culley initially went missing in Thailand before being arrested in Tbilisi International Airport on 10 May.  Mr Salakaia, who does not speak English and specialises in juvenile law, said the teenager was not aware of what was in her suitcase.  Addressing the court, Mr Salakaia said the teenager tried to inform customs officers in Thailand 'but nobody paid attention'.  'She was instructed to fly to Georgia - she did not even know where Georgia was located geographically.'  He also told the court that Miss Culley was 18 weeks pregnant.  Her family were ready to pay 50,000 georgian lari for bail money to get her out of prison, he said.  Miss Culley had been detained for 52 days before trial while the prosecution investigated where the 12kg (26lbs) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lbs) of hashish found in a travel bag came from, and whether she was planning on handing it over to someone else.  Judge Lela Kalichenko remanded her into custody until the next court hearing scheduled for 10 July.  Miss Culley's father, aunt and grandfather were all in attendance at the small courtroom in Tbilisi.  Bella Culley was detained in prison number 5, in the city of Rustavi  Georgian Police said officers had seized marijuana and the narcotic drug hashish in a travel bag at Tbilisi International Airport.  The BBC understands Miss Culley arrived in Tbilisi on a flight from Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, on 10 May.  The BBC has been told the British Embassy has advised the teenager's family not to speak to the press.  A Georgian police spokesperson said the arrest was the result of a joint operation between multiple departments and, if she was found guilty, Miss Culley could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment.

"House prices see biggest monthly fall for over two years","UK house prices recorded their biggest monthly fall for more than two years in June, according to mortgage lender Nationwide.  Prices fell by 0.8% last month, the sharpest decline since February 2023, which the building society said may reflect weaker demand following the changes to stamp duty in April.  Over the year, prices were up 2.1%, although that was the slowest annual growth rate for nearly a year.  However, Nationwide said it expected activity in the housing market to pick up in the months ahead.  Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said the situation for many potential homebuyers remained 'supportive'.  He noted that the unemployment rate remains low, earnings are still outpacing inflation and borrowing costs could become cheaper if the Bank of England makes further cuts to interest rates.  Changes to stamp duty that came into effect in April mean that housebuyers in England and Northern Ireland now pay the tax on properties over £125,000, instead of over £250,000, as was the case previously.  First-time buyers also have to pay stamp duty on homes costing more than £300,000, whereas before the April change, there was no charge unless the property was above £425,000.  Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, noted that monthly house price changes 'can be quite volatile and this has been exaggerated by April's change in stamp duty thresholds'.  This change distorted the market over the first half of the year, he said, as deals were rushed through at the end of March.  '[Since April] the housing market has been in a soft patch, but we think this will prove temporary, with the rise in May's mortgage approvals for new home purchases, which lead housing transactions, already indicating it's starting to fade.'  Rosie Hooper, chartered financial planner at Quilter Cheviot, said the housing market was 'still digesting' the stamp duty reforms in April.  'They will soon become the norm, and their immediate impact will fade into the rear-view mirror. First-time buyers and movers alike are already beginning to adjust to the new thresholds, which should help stabilise activity over the coming months,' she said.  Nationwide's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.  In general, the housing market has reflected the slow growth of the wider economy. Some people have chosen to delay moves owing to concern over their jobs and wages.  The mortgage market has also been steady and unspectacular. However, the prospect of further cuts in interest rates has prompted some extra competition among lenders in recent days.  First-time buyers continue to face the difficulty of raising a deposit, while often having to pay relatively high levels of rent.  Are you trying to buy a house? Share your experiences.

"Manslaughter arrests in Lucy Letby hospital investigation","Lucy Letby was convicted of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murder of seven others  Three former senior staff at the hospital where nurse Lucy Letby murdered seven babies and attempted to kill seven others have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.  They worked on the senior leadership team at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016 and were bailed after being questioned on Monday.  The arrests came after an investigation into potential corporate manslaughter at the hospital was opened in 2023, and then widened in March this year to include gross negligence manslaughter.  Letby, 35, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole life prison sentences after targeting babies at the hospital's neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.  She was convicted of making two attempts to kill one of the babies.  Cheshire Police said the arrests 'did not impact on the convictions of Lucy Letby for multiple offences of murder and attempted murder'.  Det Supt Paul Hughes said the corporate manslaughter element of the investigation focused on the senior leadership of the hospital and its decision-making, 'to determine whether any criminality has taken place concerning the response to the increased levels of fatalities'.  He said gross negligence manslaughter was a separate offence and 'focuses on the grossly negligent action or inaction of individuals'.  Corporate manslaughter can carry an unlimited fine for an organisation but no jail sentence for any individual, whereas gross negligence manslaughter can result in a life sentence for a person convicted of it.  The three people arrested have not been named by police, in line with normal police procedure.  A separate investigation was launched into the senior leadership of the hospital in 2023 after Letby was found guilty  Cheshire Police said it was also carrying out a separate investigation into deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies in Chester and in the Liverpool Women's Hospital, where Letby trained for periods, going back to 2012.  Det Supt Hughes said there were 'no set timescales' for the manslaughter investigations.  Letby has maintained her innocence and her barrister, Mark McDonald, submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) earlier this year.  The application included the findings of 14 medical experts who agreed to re-examine the evidence heard at trial and concluded Letby had not harmed any babies.  The CCRC, which has the power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal, said it was reviewing the application and could give no timescale on when a decision would be reached.  Mr McDonald said the news of the arrests had come at a 'very sensitive' time in his client's case.  'Despite this the concerns many have raised will not go away, and we will continue to publicly discuss them,' he said.  He added that 'internationally renowned experts' had concluded that no babies were murdered and called for a new public inquiry into 'failings' in neonatal and paediatric care at the Countess of Chester.  Lucy Letby, pictured during her arrest at her home  Last month former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for an 'urgent re-examination' of Letby's case due to what he called 'serious and credible' questions raised by the expert panel.  His Conservative Party colleague, Sir David Davis, has also been supportive of attempts to have Letby's case looked at again.  But lawyers for the families of Letby's victims described the expert panel's conclusions as 'full of analytical holes' and 'a rehash' of the defence case.  A public inquiry into the circumstances around Letby's offending is also due to publish its findings in early 2026.  The Thirwall Inquiry heard evidence from the senior leadership team at the hospital about when concerns were raised about a rise in the deaths of babies on the neonatal unit.

"Chief Rabbi says 'vile Jew-hatred at Glastonbury' a 'national shame'","Sir Ephraim Mirvis made his comments after a live broadcast of Bob Vylan at Glastonbury festival went out on the BBC  The UK's chief rabbi has strongly criticised 'the airing of vile Jew-hate at Glastonbury' after a live broadcast of Bob Vylan's performance at the festival went out on the BBC, during which the band's singer led the crowd in chants of 'death, death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]'.  Sir Ephraim Mirvis wrote on X:, external 'This is a time of national shame. The airing of vile Jew-hatred at Glastonbury and the BBC's belated and mishandled response, brings confidence in our national broadcaster's ability to treat antisemitism seriously to a new low.  'It should trouble all decent people that now, one need only couch their outright incitement to violence and hatred as edgy political commentary, for ordinary people to not only fail to see it for what it is, but also to cheer it, chant it and celebrate it. Toxic Jew-hatred is a threat to our entire society.'  Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy expressed concern over the situation, saying about the BBC: 'When there is one editorial failure, it is something that must be gripped; where there are several, it becomes a problem of leadership.'  She added: 'This government supports the BBC... that is why we are so disappointed that this has happened and have been so exasperated with the lack of account from the leadership not just about this, but about a previous Gaza documentary and a number of other issues.  'The BBC is one of the most important institutions in our country and that is why it is held to the highest of standards.'  Bob Vylan responded to the outcry in a post on Instagram on Tuesday, external, saying they had been 'targeted for speaking up'.  'We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine,' they said.  They added that 'we, like those in the spotlight before us, are not the story. We are a distraction from the story, and whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.'  The BBC did not respond specifically to the chief rabbi's comments, but pointed to a statement released on Monday in which the corporation said the 'antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves'.  'The team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen,' the BBC said.  The corporation said it would look at its guidance for future live events 'so we can be sure teams are clear on when it is acceptable to keep output on air'.  BBC director general Tim Davie was at Glastonbury for a few hours on the day of Bob Vylan's performance.  The corporation said he was 'informed of the incident and at that point he was clear it should not feature in any other Glastonbury coverage'.  The BBC's editorial guidelines say editors should 'assess the risk of a problem arising in our live output', ranging from a local radio phone-in to high-profile events like music festivals or sporting fixtures, or breaking news or stories of a sensitive nature, such as a siege.  During their set, Bob Vylan's singer Pascal Robinson-Foster, who performs under the name Bobby Vylan, also spoke about a record label boss he used to work for.  That boss would 'speak very strongly about his support for Israel', and had put his name to a letter urging Glastonbury to cancel Irish-language rap trio Kneecap's performance, the musician said.  'Who do I see on that list of names but that bald-headed [expletive] I used to work for. We've done it all, all right? From working in bars to working for [expletive] Zionists.'  Andrew Gilbert, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said he and others were 'absolutely horrified and are still absolutely perplexed' by the on-stage comments and their broadcast.  He said the BBC 'could have stopped and restarted the stream' and 'could have done more vetting in advance'.  A criminal investigation was launched on Monday over performances by both Bob Vylan and Kneecap at Glastonbury on Saturday, Avon and Somerset Police have said.  They have not specified which parts of Bob Vylan's or Kneecap's sets could be subject to the criminal investigation.  The force said it had appointed a senior detective to investigate whether comments made by either act amounted to a criminal offence after reviewing footage.  A statement added: 'This has been recorded as a public order incident at this time while our enquiries are at an early stage.'  Both members of Bob Vylan - who were due to embark on a tour of America later this year - have had their US visas revoked, it is understood.  Ms Nandy also told MPs she immediately called the BBC's director general after the set was broadcast.  She said outstanding questions remain, including why the feed 'wasn't immediately cut', why it was broadcast live 'given the concerns regarding other acts in the weeks preceding the festival', and what due diligence was done before deciding to put Bob Vylan on TV.  'When the rights and safety of people and communities are at risk, and when the national broadcaster fails to uphold its own standards, we will intervene,' she added, and said she will continue to speak to the BBC in the coming days.  Media regulator Ofcom also issued a statement, saying: 'We are very concerned about the live stream of this performance, and the BBC clearly has questions to answer.  'We have been speaking to the BBC over the weekend and we are obtaining further information as a matter of urgency, including what procedures were in place to ensure compliance with its own editorial guidelines.'  Ofcom's role includes regulating the BBC's editorial standards and complaints, external, and working to protect fair and effective competition.  Ofcom's own broadcast rules include protecting members of the public from harmful and/or offensive material.  Part of its code also covers regulating material that is likely to incite crime or disorder, reflecting the watchdog's duty to prohibit the broadcast of this type of programming.  Meanwhile, the chair of the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee has written to Mr Davie to ask for details of the BBC's procedures at Glastonbury including broadcast delays, staffing and contingency plans.  Bob Vylan are due to perform at the Radar festival in Manchester on 5 July.  A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: 'We are aware that Bob Vylan will be performing in Manchester at the weekend.  'Greater Manchester is famous for promoting music of all genres and we welcome all artists to our region. However, we will act immediately on any reports of commentary or actions that could be breaking the law.'  Meanwhile, an MP said on Monday that the row over Bob Vylan's performance at the Glastonbury Festival was a distraction from talking about the ongoing 'actual violence' in Gaza.  Ellie Chowns, Green Party MP for North Herefordshire, who attended the festival to give a talk, stressed that she completely disagreed with the punk duo urging 'death' to Israeli troops, but criticised the amount of coverage the incident has had.  'Incitement to violence is totally the opposite of my politics and I completely disagree with that: whoever it comes from, wherever it's done,' she said.

"Two rescued after father jumps after child who fell off cruise ship","This video can not be played  Watch: Rescue boat reaches father and daughter after she falls from cruise ship  A father jumped into the ocean to save his daughter after she fell from the fourth deck of a Disney cruise ship travelling from the Bahamas to the US on Sunday afternoon, witnesses say.  Videos showed passengers cheering as the two were pulled onto a rescue boat after apparently treading water for 10 minutes.  The girl appeared to fall when her father took her picture against a railing, witnesses said. A man overboard alert was broadcast on the ship, and crew rushed to recover them.  'The ship was moving quickly, so quickly, it's crazy how quickly the people became tiny dots in the sea, and then you lost sight of them,' passenger Laura Amador said.  'The captain slowed the ship and turned it around, and then they deployed a tender ship with people on it to go get them, and we saw them rescue the dad and daughter,' she told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.  The identities of the father and daughter have not been publicly released. Several US media outlets are describing the girl as a child.  The 4,000-person capacity Disney Dream, was returning to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after sailing for four days around the Bahamas.  Disney confirmed in a statement that two passengers were rescued, but offered few details about what occurred.  'The Crew aboard the Disney Dream swiftly rescued two guests from the water,' a Disney Cruise Line spokesperson said. 'We commend our Crew Members for their exceptional skills and prompt actions, which ensured the safe return of both guests to the ship within minutes.    'We watched it, you could see two little things...it was crazy, it was horrific,' passenger Gar Frantz told NBC News, describing how he witnessed the two enter the ocean and nearly disappear into the horizon.  The incident took place on the last day of the cruise, and the ship returned to port in Florida as normal.  While it is rare for passengers to fall from cruise ships, rescues are not often successful when they do.  According to a Cruise Lines International Association report from 2019, external, 25 people fell overboard that year from cruise ships and only nine were saved from the water.

"Robert Kennedy Jr: Could he really revolutionise US healthcare?","Is RFK Jr's divisive plan to Make America Healthy Again fearmongering - or revolutionary?  Listen to Jim read this article  There's a saying that Robert F Kennedy Jr is very fond of. He used it on the day he was confirmed as US health secretary. 'A healthy person has a thousand dreams, a sick person only has one,' he said as he stood in the Oval Office. '60% of our population has only one dream – that they get better.'  The most powerful public health official in the US has made it his mission to tackle what he describes as an epidemic of chronic illness in America, a catch-all term that covers everything from obesity and diabetes to heart disease.  His diagnosis that the US is experiencing an epidemic of ill health is a view shared by many healthcare experts in the country.  But Kennedy also has a history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies, from the suggestion that Covid-19 targeted and spared certain ethnic groups to the idea that chemicals in tap water could be making children transgender.  Robert F Kennedy Jr has made it his mission to tackle what he describes as an epidemic of chronic illness in America  And after taking office, he slashed thousands of jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services and eliminated whole programmes at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  'On the one hand, it's extraordinarily exciting to have a federal official take on chronic disease,' says Marion Nestle, a retired professor of public health at New York University. 'On the other, the dismantling of the federal public health apparatus cannot possibly help with the agenda.'  RFK Jr and the future of vaccines in the US  01/07/2025  Kennedy is reviled by parts of the medical and scientific communities. He was described to me as an 'evil nihilist' by Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University.  But even some of Kennedy's critics accept that he is bringing drive and ambition to areas of healthcare that have been neglected. Is it possible that the man who attracts so much criticism - and in some quarters, hate - might actually start making America healthy again?  There's one industry that Kennedy had set his sights on long before joining the Trump administration: multinational food companies have, he has said, poisoned American children with artificial additives already banned in other countries.  'We have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now,' he claimed on Fox News last year.  His first target was food colourings, with a promise to phase out the use of petroleum-based dyes by the end of 2026.  Chemicals, with names like 'Green No. 3' and 'Red No. 40', have been linked to hyperactivity and behavioural issues in children, and cancer in some animal studies.  'What's happening in this administration is really interesting,' says Vani Hari, a food blogger and former Democrat who is now an influential voice in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. 'MAHA is all about how do we get people off processed food, and one way to do that is to regulate the chemicals companies use.'  There are some signs this pressure may be paying off.  The food giant PepsiCo, for example, said in a recent trading update that Lays crisps and Tostitos snacks 'will be out of artificial colours by the end of this year'.  Robert Kennedy backs a food bill in Texas that could target additives in certain fizzy drinks (not necessarily those pictured)  Kennedy struck a voluntary agreement with the food industry but it only came after individual states from California to West Virginia had already started introducing their own laws.  'In the case of food dyes, companies will have to act because states are banning them [anyway] and they won't want to have to formulate separate products for separate states,' says Prof Nestle, an author and longtime critic of the industry.  More recently Kennedy has signalled he backs a radical food bill in Texas that could target additives in some products ranging from sweets, to cereals and fizzy drinks.  Packets may soon have to carry a high-contrast label stating, 'WARNING: This product contains an ingredient that is not recommended for human consumption by the appropriate authority in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the United Kingdom.'  The Consumer Brands Association, which represents some of the largest food manufacturers, opposes this, saying the ingredients used in the US food supply are safe and have been rigorously studied.  It's difficult to imagine that kind of regulation could ever be signed off in a state like Texas without the political backing of Kennedy and President Trump.  'He can't change everything in a short amount of time, but I think the issue of food dyes will soon be history,' says Ms Hari, who testified before the Senate on this subject last year.  But others worry that the flurry of announcements on additives is tinkering around the edges of what is a much wider problem.  'While some of these individual actions are important, they are a drop in the ocean in the larger context of chronic disease,' argues Nicola Hawley, professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health. 'There is a focus on personal choice and access to natural food, but that completely ignores the big, systematic and structural barriers [to healthy eating] like poverty and really aggressive marketing of junk food to children.'  The US government, for example, still heavily subsidises crops including corn and soya beans, key ingredients in processed foods.  Kennedy is now updating the US national dietary guidelines, an important document used to shape everything from school meals to assistance programmes for the elderly. A reduction in added sugars and a switch to more locally sourced whole foods is expected. Plus he has called on states to ban millions of Americans from using food stamps, a welfare benefit, to buy junk food or sugar-sweetened drinks.  He has also backed local officials who want to stop adding fluoride to drinking water, describing it as a 'dangerous neurotoxin'. It is used in some countries, including in parts of the US, to prevent tooth decay, and whilst there is still debate about the possible health effects, the NHS says a review of the risks has found 'no convincing evidence' to support any concerns. Other fluoride research has found the mineral only has detrimental health effects at extremely high levels.  Prof Hawley also argues there is a tension between Kennedy's 'important message' on food and chronic disease, and what she feels is a lack of policies backed by solid scientific evidence.  'You've got this challenge of him drifting into misinformation about the links between additives and chronic disease, or environmental risk factors,' she argues. 'And that really just undermines the science.'  That tension is even clearer when it comes to another of Kennedy's big concerns.  Vaccines are still listed on the CDC website as one of the great public health achievements of the last century, alongside family planning and tobacco control. They prevent countless cases of disease and disability each year, and save millions of lives, according to the American Medical Association.  Kennedy, though, is the best-known vaccine sceptic in the country. The activist group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccination.  In 2019 he described the disgraced British doctor Andrew Wakefield as the 'most unfairly maligned person in modern history' and told a crowd in Washington that 'any just society' would be building statues of him.  Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register in 2010 after his research falsely linked the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to autism, leading to a spike in measles cases in England and some other countries.  Over the last year, Kennedy has repeatedly insisted he is not 'anti-vax' and will not be 'taking away anybody's vaccines'. Faced with a deadly measles outbreak in unvaccinated children in west Texas, he posted that the MMR was 'the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease'.  In other comments though, he described vaccination as?a 'personal choice' and emphasised alternative treatments such as vitamin A supplements.  A huge deal with the drugmaker Moderna to develop a vaccine to combat bird flu in humans was scrapped, and new rules were brought in which could mean some vaccines need extra testing before they can be updated each winter.  In May, Kennedy posted a video on social media saying the government would no longer endorse Covid vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.  However, some doctors point out that reducing eligibility would simply bring the US into line with other countries, including the UK, where free Covid boosters are restricted to those over 75 or with weakened immune systems.  'They are really just aligning themselves with everyone else, which is not in any way outrageous,' says Prof Adam Finn, a paediatric doctor and one of the UK's leading experts on vaccines.  Over the last year, Kennedy has insisted he is not 'anti-vax' and will not be 'taking away anybody's vaccines'  Then in June, Kennedy suddenly sacked all 17 members of the influential expert committee, which advises the CDC on vaccine eligibility. He accused the panel of being 'plagued with persistent conflicts of interest' and rubber-stamping new vaccines without proper scrutiny.  A new, much smaller, committee handpicked by the administration now has the power to change, or even drop, critical recommendations to immunise Americans for certain diseases, as well as shape the childhood vaccination programme.  'It underscores just how much we are backsliding now,' says Dr Amesh Adalja, the infectious disease doctor and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University. 'I think increasingly the panel will become irrelevant if RFK Jr is able to shape it the way he wants to.'  The new panel made its first decision last week, voting to stop recommending a small number of flu vaccines that still contain the preservative thimerosal, something Kennedy wrote a book about in 2015.  His critics say that a new era of vaccine policy has arrived in the US. Whilst his supporters say no subject, including vaccine safety, should be considered off-limits.  'Everything has to be open to discussion and Bobby Kennedy is not anti-vaccine, he's anti-corruption,' argues Tony Lyons, who co-founded the political action committee that supported his independent presidential campaign.  'It's about being pro-science, pro-capitalism, and believing you have an obligation to the public to do a thorough job of researching any product that is put in the arms of 40 million children.'  Weeks after Kennedy took office news emerged that the CDC would open a research project into the link between vaccines and autism.  Since Wakefield's now-discredited Lancet paper in 1998, which linked autism to the MMR vaccine given to children, there have been numerous international studies that have looked at this in detail and found no reputable link.  'There is nothing to debate any more, it has been settled by science,' says Eric Fombonne, an autism researcher and professor emeritus at Oregon Health & Science University.  Kennedy, though, has hired David Geier, a noted vaccine sceptic, to look again at the data.  Today autism is widely understood to be a lifelong spectrum condition. It can include those with high support needs who are non-speaking, and those with above-average intelligence who might struggle with social interaction or communication.  Most researchers believe a rise in cases over decades is down to a broadening in the way children with autism are defined, as well as improved awareness, understanding and screening.  But in April, Kennedy dismissed that idea, describing autism as 'preventable'. He blamed a mysterious environmental trigger for the increase in eight-year-olds being diagnosed.  'This is coming from an environmental toxin… [in] our air, our water, our medicines, our food,' he said.  RFK Jr blamed a mysterious environmental trigger for the increase in eight-year-olds being diagnosed with autism  He pledged a massive research effort to find that cause by September and 'eliminate those exposures'.  Dr Fombonne strongly disputes this. 'It is nonsensical and shows a complete absence of understanding,' he says. 'We have known for many years that autism has a strong genetic component.'  In the same speech, Kennedy said that many autistic children will never 'pay taxes, never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.'  Many in the autism community are angry. 'What we're seeing here is a fear-based rhetoric and [a] misleading narrative that is causing harm and perpetuating stigma,' says Kristyn Roth from the Autism Society of America.  But some parents of autistic children are more supportive.  Emily May, a writer who is the mother of a child with autism, wrote in The New York Times that she found herself 'nodding along as Mr Kennedy spoke about the grim realities of profound autism'.  'His remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation,' she wrote.  The administration has since watered down that promise to find the reasons for autism by September but it is still promising detailed findings of its research by March 2026.  Ultimately, Robert Kennedy has only been in the job a matter of months. Already though he's asking some big questions – particularly about chronic disease – which have never been asked in the same way by a health secretary before.  For the first time that issue has both political attention and bipartisan support in the US.  He is clearly not afraid to take on what he perceives to be vested interests in the food and drug industries, and he is still firmly supported by President Trump.  Tony Lyons, who has published books by Kennedy, calls him 'uniquely qualified' for the most powerful job in US public health. 'He's a corruption fighter. He has seen what all these kinds of companies do, not just pharmaceutical companies but food companies, and he wants them to do a better job,' he says.  Robert Kennedy's background as an environmental lawyer taking on big business and the establishment has clearly shaped the views he holds today.  But Jerold Mande, a former federal food policy advisor in three administrations, worries that Kennedy's own views and biases will mean some of the solutions he's reaching for are predetermined and unsupported by the evidence.  Now a professor of nutrition at Harvard, Prof Mande describes Kennedy as an imperfect messenger and says he has 'great concerns' about the administration's approach to aspects of public health, from tobacco control to vaccination, where there is 'no question that what he's doing is going to result in enormous harm.'  'At a high level, I'm optimistic... but you still need to come up with the right answers, and those answers can only be found through science,' says Prof Mande.  'We now have a shot and he's provided that by making it a priority. But it's how you use that shot that's going to determine whether it's a success or not. And that is where the jury is still out.'

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday stuck to his position that the central bank will keep its key rate on hold while it waits to see how President Donald Trump’s tariffs effect the economy, despite the steady stream of criticism from the White House, which wants lower borrowing costs.  Powell, speaking in Sintra, Portugal, at a conference hosted by the European Central Bank, also said that U.S. inflation is likely to pick up later this summer, though he acknowledged that the timing and magnitude of any price increase from the duties is uncertain. But he said the Fed will keep rates on hold while it evaluates the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy.  “As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,” Powell said, referring to the sweeping duties Trump has imposed this year.  Powell’s comments underscored the divide between the U.S. central bank’s leader and the Trump administration. Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut its key rate, which he says would save U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars on interest costs on the federal government’s massive debt, and boost the economy. The fight has threatened the Fed’s traditional independence from politics, though since the Supreme Court signaled the president can’t fire the chair, financial markets haven’t responded to Trump’s criticism.  The Fed chair also said that without tariffs, the Fed would probably be cutting its key rate right now. The central bank went “on hold” after it saw how large Trump’s proposed tariffs were, Powell said, and economists began forecasting higher inflation.    At the same time, Powell did not rule out a rate cut at the Fed’s next policy meeting July 29-30.  “I wouldn’t take any meeting off the table or put it directly on the table,” Powell said. Most economists, however, expect the Fed won’t reduce rates until September at the earliest.  On Monday, the president attacked Powell again and extended his criticisms to the entire Fed governing board, which participates in interest-rate decisions.  “The board just sits there and watches, so they are equally to blame,” Trump said. The attack on the board ratchets up pressure on individual Fed officials, such as Governor Chris Waller, who have been mentioned as potential successors to Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.  When asked during a panel discussion with other central bankers what keeps him awake at night, Powell referred to the fact that there are just 10 months left in his term.  “All I want and all anybody at the Fed wants is to deliver an economy that has price stability, maximum employment, financial stability,” he said.  Powell was also asked whether Trump’s attacks make his job harder, and he responded, “I’m very focused on just doing my job.”  The other central bankers onstage, including Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, and Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, joined the audience in applauding Powell’s comment.  “We would do exactly the same thing as Jay Powell has done,” Lagarde said. “The same thing.”  On Monday, Trump posted a note on social media that listed 44 countries in order of the interest rates set by their central banks. The list showed that Switzerland, Cambodia, and Japan have the lowest short-term rates of 0.25% to 0.5%. “Should be here,” Trump wrote on the list, referring to the Fed.  Yet central banks typically lower their rates when their economies are weaker, to boost borrowing and spending and support growth. The Fed cut its short-term rate to nearly zero during the pandemic for that reason. It rapidly lifted borrowing costs in 2022 and 2023 to combat the worst inflation spike in four decades.  Trump has been particularly focused on the idea that Fed rate cuts would sharply reduce the government’s borrowing costs.  Yet it’s not necessarily the case that a cut would lower other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, car loans, or business loans. The short-term rate the Fed controls influences other interest rates, but the markets also play a significant role.  As a result, a rate cut by the Fed wouldn’t automatically lower the interest rates paid by Treasury securities, particularly longer-term rates such as the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which strongly affects mortgage rates.  In fact, when the Powell Fed first cut its short-term rate last September, the 10-year yield actually rose, lifting mortgage rates and other borrowing costs.  The Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged this year, at about 4.3%, after cutting it three times in 2024.  At a news conference in June, Powell suggested that the central bank would “learn a great deal more over the summer” about whether President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs would push up inflation or not. The comment suggested the Fed wouldn’t consider cutting rates until its September meeting.  Yet a few days later, Fed governors Waller and Michelle Bowman, who were both appointed by Trump, said that it was unlikely the tariffs would lead to persistent inflation. Both also indicated that they would likely support reducing the Fed’s rate in July.  So far, inflation has mostly continued to cool, despite the imposition of the duties on nearly all U.S. imports. Consumer prices rose just 2.4% in May compared with a year earlier, not far from the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and much lower than a year ago.        Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)  Musk’s renewed heckling of Trump’s big tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed the Senate on Tuesday, threatens to put billions of dollars of his government contracts in jeopardy if Trump retaliates. The rupture of their tenuous peace has resulted in a wobbling of the stock price of a market-moving company and led the president to muse about deporting Musk to his native South Africa.      In a Frankenstein-style twist, as Musk volleyed fresh critiques about the cost of Trump’s signature legislation, Trump mused Tuesday about turning Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency back on its creator.  “DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a tour of a new immigration detention center in Florida.  Trump also suggested in an early morning social media post that if Musk lost his government contracts, he “would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa.”  Asked by a reporter later if he would deport Musk, Trump paused and said, “I don’t know. We’ll have to take a look.”  In response, Musk wrote on X: “So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.” Tesla and SpaceX did not respond to messages seeking comment about their CEO.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)      Musk has called Trump’s big bill a financial boondoggle for America that would kill jobs and bog down burgeoning industries. He’s not limiting himself to harsh assessments on social media. On Monday, he threatened to reinsert himself into politics and try to oust every member of Congress who votes for the bill.  “They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk said in one post.  In other posts, he branded Republicans “the PORKY PIG PARTY!!” and threatened to create a new political party.  Trump has said Musk is actually irritated by the legislation’s dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles and related technologies. Musk has denied this, but the rollback could hurt Tesla’s finances.  “Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social media network.  Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002, according to a biography of him by Walter Isaacson. It’s unclear if Trump would take the extraordinary step of having the government explore the rare process of removing his citizenship, known as denaturalization.      Musk’s rocket and satellite company, SpaceX, is also in Trump’s crosshairs.  “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,” Trump said in his post. “BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”  SpaceX has received billions of federal dollars to help send astronauts into space and perform other work for NASA, including a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.  But the most immediate fallout of their feud was the tumbling stock in Tesla, down 5.3% on Tuesday.  Tesla stock’s performance can have an outsize impact on the stock market index funds in which millions of Americans’ 401(k)s have invested their retirement savings. The electric vehicle maker is one of the Magnificent Seven, the group of companies that includes Apple and Google parent Alphabet and that account for about a third of the value of the S&P 500.  Musk’s social media outbursts come at a delicate time for his car company. Tesla is just a week into its test run of its self-driving “robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas. Musk needs that test to succeed if he hopes to make good on his promise to investors that he will be able to quickly offer the service in other cities over the next few months.  One possible hurdle to that: federal safety regulators.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requested information from Tesla last week after videos began circulating on social media of a few of its autonomous cabs in Austin driving erratically, including one heading down an opposing lane.  That followed a NHTSA request for data last month on how the driverless taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions, which itself followed an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.  Musk needs robotaxis to take off because Tesla’s main business of selling cars is going poorly.    Musk has acknowledged that boycotts by people angry with his political views have hurt sales, but he has largely blamed a less frightening, temporary factor: People are so excited about Tesla’s forthcoming latest version of their Model Y SUV that they decided to hold off on purchases for a few months.  But now that the new version is available, and sales are still tanking. Figures out last week showed sales in Europe plunged 28% in May over the prior year, the fifth month in a row of big drops. A new batch of sales data, including the U.S. and other parts of the world, is coming out on Wednesday.  The irony is that Musk’s social media spat with Trump threatens his businesses from both sides. People won’t buy his cars because of the memories of his friendship with Trump, and now that and his other businesses could get hurt because that friendship has soured.  “In a bizzarro world, he’s alienated both sides,” said Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities financial analyst. “It seems impossible, but he’s actually done it.”  ___  Condon and Chapman reported from New York.

(AP Phot/Vahid Salemi)  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran is assessing the damage and lashing out over the American and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear sites, though Tehran kept open the possibility Tuesday of resuming talks with Washington over its atomic program.  The comments by government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani also included another acknowledgment that Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz — key sites within Iran’s nuclear program — had been “seriously damaged” by the American strikes. Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency quoted Mohajerani as making the remarks at a briefing for journalists.  That acknowledgment comes as Iran’s theocracy has slowly begun to admit the scale of the damage wrought by the 12-day war with Israel, which saw Israeli fighter jets decimate the country’s air defenses and conduct strikes at will over the Islamic Republic. And keeping the door open to talks with the United States likely shows Tehran wants to avoid further economic pain as another deadline over U.N. sanctions looms.  “No date (for U.S. talks) is announced, and it’s not probably very soon, but a decision hasn’t been made in this field,” Mohajerani said.  From AP’s Standards and Stylebook teams:  The AP is calling the conflict between Israel and Iran a war, given the scope, intensity and duration of military activities on both sides. Click here for an explanation of this decision.  Israeli airstrikes, which began June 13, decimated the upper ranks of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard and targeted its arsenal of ballistic missiles. The strikes also hit Iran’s nuclear sites, which Israel claimed put Tehran within reach of a nuclear weapon. U.S. intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency had assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.  On Monday, Iranian judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir offered a sharply increased, government-issued death toll from the war. He said that the Israeli attacks killed 935 “Iranian citizens,” including 38 children and 102 women, IRNA reported.  “The enemy aimed to change the country’s circumstances by assassinating military commanders and scientists, intending to spread fear and exert pressure,” Jahangir added. However, he asserted — like others up to 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — that Iran had “won” the war.  Iran has a long history of offering lower death counts around unrest over political considerations. The Washington-based Human Rights Activists group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, has put the death toll at 1,190 people killed, including 436 civilians and 435 security force members. The attacks wounded another 4,475 people, the group said.  Meanwhile, it appears that Iranian officials now are assessing the damage done by the American strikes conducted on the three nuclear sites on June 22, including those at Fordo, a site built under a mountain about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tehran.  Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show Iranian officials at Fordo on Monday likely examining the damage caused by American bunker busters. Trucks could be seen in the images, as well as at least one crane and an excavator at tunnels on the site. That corresponded to images shot Sunday by Maxar Technologies similarly showing the ongoing work.  The tunnels likely had been filled in by Iran before the strikes to protect the facility. The presence of trucks before the attacks has raised questions about whether any enriched uranium or centrifuges had been spirited away before the attack, something repeatedly claimed by Iranian officials. Even before the strikes, the IAEA warned that its inspectors had lost their “continuity of knowledge” regarding the program, meaning material could be at undeclared sites in the country.  Iran hasn’t said what work is being done at the sites, though it has said that the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran planned to issue a report about the damage done by the strikes.  Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, whose profile sharply rose during the war, also has kept open the possibility of talks with the U.S.  However, hard-liners within Iran are increasingly criticizing any effort at negotiations or cooperation with the West. Iran’s hard-line Kayhan newspaper, in a piece written by its Khamenei-appointed managing editor, Hossein Shariatmadari, mocked any possible talks Tuesday by saying being a “traitor or stupid are two sides of the same coin.”  Shariatmadari’s newspaper on Saturday also suggested that the IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi, should be “tried and executed” if he visited Iran — something that drew immediate criticism from European nations and others.

"Mystery about Epstein files after Bondi cites 'tens of thousands' of videos","Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.    Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  Attorney General Pam Bondi’s comments about evidence the Justice Department is reviewing from its Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation have fueled anticipation about the expected release of more files related to the New York financier.  WASHINGTON (AP) — It was a surprising statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi as the Trump administration promises to release more files from its sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein: The FBI, she said, was reviewing “tens of thousands of videos” of the wealthy financier “with children or child porn.”  The comment, made to reporters at the White House days after a similar remark to a stranger with a hidden camera, raised the stakes for President Donald Trump’s administration to prove it has in its possession previously unseen compelling evidence. That task is all the more pressing after an earlier document dump that Bondi hyped angered elements of Trump’s base by failing to deliver new bombshells and as administration officials who had promised to unlock supposed secrets of the so-called government “deep state” struggle to fulfill that pledge.  Yet weeks after Bondi’s remarks, it remains unclear what she was referring to.  This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File)  This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File)  The Associated Press spoke with lawyers and law enforcement officials in criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who said they hadn’t seen and didn’t know of a trove of recordings like what Bondi described. Indictments and detention memos do not reference the existence of videos of Epstein with children, and neither was charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that offense would have been much easier to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.  AP correspondent Julie Walker reports mystery surrounds the Jeffrey Epstein files after the Attorney General claims there are ‘tens of thousands’ of videos.  One potential clue may lie in a little-noticed 2023 court filing — among hundreds of documents reviewed by the AP — in which Epstein’s estate was revealed to have located an unspecified number of videos and photos that it said might contain child sex abuse material. But even that remains shrouded in secrecy with lawyers involved in that civil case saying a protective order prevents them from discussing it.    The filing suggests a discovery of recordings after the criminal cases had concluded, but if that’s what Bondi was referencing, the Justice Department has not said.  The department declined repeated requests from the AP to speak with officials overseeing the Epstein review. Spokespeople did not answer a list of questions about Bondi’s comments, including when and where the recordings were procured, what they depict and whether they were newly discovered as authorities dug through their evidence collection or were known for some time to have been in the government’s possession.  “Outside sources who make assertions about materials included in the DOJ’s review cannot speak to what materials are included in the DOJ’s review,” spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said in a statement.  Epstein’s crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a coverup. Elon Musk entered the frenzy during his acrimonious fallout with Trump when he said without evidence in a since-deleted social media post that the reason the Epstein files have yet to be released is that the Republican president is featured in them.  During a Fox News Channel interview in February, Bondi suggested an alleged Epstein “client list” was sitting on her desk. The Justice Department after that distributed binders marked “declassified” to far-right influencers at the White House, but it quickly became clear much of the information had long been in the public domain. No “client list” was disclosed, and there’s no evidence such a document exists.  The flop left conservatives fuming and failed to tamp down conspiracy theories that for years have spiraled around Epstein’s case. Right wing-personality Laura Loomer called on Bondi to resign, branding her a “total liar.”  Afterward, Bondi said an FBI “source” informed her of the existence of thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents and ordered the bureau to provide the “full and complete Epstein files,” including any videos. Employees since then have logged hours reviewing records to prepare them for release. It’s unclear when that might happen.  In April, Bondi was approached in a restaurant by a woman with a hidden camera who asked about the status of the Epstein files release. Bondi replied that there were tens of thousands of videos “and it’s all with little kids,” so she said the FBI had to go through each one.  After conservative activist James O’Keefe, who obtained and later publicized the hidden-camera video, alerted the Justice Department to the encounter, Bondi told reporters at the White House: “There are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn.”  The comments tapped into long-held suspicions that, despite the release over the years of thousands of records documenting Epstein’s activities, damaging details about him or other prominent figures remain concealed.  The situation was further muddied by recent comments from FBI Director Kash Patel to podcaster Joe Rogan that did not repeat Bondi’s account about tens of thousands of videos.  Though not asked explicitly about Bondi, Patel dismissed the possibility of incriminating videos of powerful Epstein friends, saying, “If there was a video of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I’m in charge, don’t you think you’d see it?” Asked whether the narrative “might not be accurate that there’s video of these guys doing this,” he replied, “Exactly.”  Epstein’s suicide in August 2019, weeks after his arrest, prevented a trial in New York and cut short the discovery process in which evidence is shared among lawyers.  But even in a subsequent prosecution of Maxwell, in which such evidence would presumably have been relevant given the nature of the accusations against an alleged co-conspirator, salacious videos of Epstein with children never surfaced nor were part of the case, said one of her lawyers.  “We were never provided with any of those materials. I suspect if they existed, we would have seen them, and I’ve never seen them, so I have no idea what she’s talking about,” said Jeffrey Pagliuca, who represented Maxwell in a 2021 trial in which she was convicted of luring teenage girls to be molested by Epstein.

(AP Photo/Dominique Mollard, File)  To be sure, photographs of nude or seminude girls have long been known to be part of the government’s case. Investigators recovered possibly thousands of such pictures while searching his Manhattan mansion, and a videorecorded walk-through by law enforcement of his Palm Beach, Florida, home revealed sexually suggestive photographs displayed inside, court records show.  Accounts from more than one accuser of feeling watched or seeing cameras or surveillance equipment in Epstein’s properties have contributed to public expectations of sexual recordings. A 2020 Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility report on the handling of an earlier Epstein investigation hinted at that possibility, saying police who searched his Palm Beach home in 2005 found computer keyboards, monitors and disconnected surveillance cameras, but the equipment — including video recordings and other electronic items — was missing.  There’s no indication prosecutors obtained any missing equipment during the later federal investigation, and the indictment against him included no recording allegations.  An AP review of hundreds of documents in the Maxwell and Epstein criminal cases identified no reference to tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with underage girls.  “I don’t recall personally ever having that kind of discussion,” said one Epstein lawyer, Marc Fernich, who couldn’t rule out such evidence wasn’t located later. “It’s not something I ever heard about.”  In one nonspecific reference to video evidence, prosecutors said in a 2020 filing that they would produce to Maxwell’s lawyers thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s electronic devices in response to a warrant.  But Pagliuca said his recollection was those videos consisted largely of recordings in which Epstein was “musing” into a recording device — “Epstein talking to Epstein,” he said.  Complicating efforts to assess the Epstein evidence is the volume of accusers, court cases and districts where legal wrangling has occurred, including after Epstein’s suicide and Maxwell’s conviction.  The cases include 2022 lawsuits in Manhattan’s federal court from an accuser identified as Jane Doe 1 and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein had a home, alleging that financial services giant JPMorgan Chase failed to heed red flags about him being a “high-risk” customer.  Lawyers issued a subpoena for any video recordings or photos that could bolster their case.  They told a judge months later the Epstein estate had alerted them that it had found content that “might contain child sex abuse imagery” while responding to the subpoena and requested a protocol for handling “videorecorded material and photographs.” The judge ordered representatives of Epstein’s estate to review the materials before producing them to lawyers and to alert the FBI to possible child sexual abuse imagery.  Court filings don’t detail the evidence or say how many videos or images were found, and it’s unclear whether the recordings Bondi referenced were the same ones.  The estate’s disclosure was later included by a plaintiffs’ lawyer, Jennifer Freeman, in a complaint to the FBI and the Justice Department asserting that investigators had failed over the years to adequately collect potential evidence of child sex abuse material.  Freeman cited Bondi’s comments in a new lawsuit on behalf of an Epstein accuser who alleges he assaulted her in 1996. In an interview, Freeman said she had not seen recordings and had no direct knowledge but wanted to understand what Bondi meant.  “I want to know what she’s addressing, what is she talking about — I’d like to know that,” she said.  ___  Associated Press journalist Aaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.

"Ukrainian drone strikes a Russian plant","Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.    Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  A Russian drone attacks a building during Russia’s massive missile and drone air attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, June 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky, file)  KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone struck a Russian industrial plant some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from Ukraine, a local official said Tuesday, after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prioritized the weapon’s development and Russia pounded Ukraine with a monthly record of drones in June.  Both sides in the more than three-year war following Russia’s February 2022 invasion of its neighbor have raced to improve drone technology and enhance their use on the battlefield. They have deployed increasingly sophisticated and deadlier drones, turning the war into a testing ground for the new weaponry.  Ukraine is under severe strain from a Russian push at places on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, but analysts say its defenses are largely holding firm. With recent direct peace talks delivering no progress on U.S.-led international efforts to halt the fighting, Russia and Ukraine are bulking up their arsenals.  Russia last month launched 5,438 drones at Ukraine, a new monthly record, according to official data collated by The Associated Press.    Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone hit an industrial plant in Izhevsk, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of Moscow, killing three people and injuring 35, Alexander Brechalov, head of the Udmurtia region, said. The plant’s workers were evacuated, he said.  The drone struck the Kupol Electromechanical Plant, which produces air defense systems and drones for the Russian military, according to an official with Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU.  At least two direct hits were recorded on the plant’s buildings, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.  Ukraine has for months been using domestically produced long-range drones to strike plants, storage sites and logistical hubs deep inside Russian territory. In May last year, a Ukrainian drone hit an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Kyiv officials claimed.  Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s domestic production of drones is about to increase in response to Russia’s expanded barrages.  “The priority is drones, interceptor drones and long-range strike drones,” he said on Telegram late Monday.  “This is extremely important,” he added. “Russia is investing in its unmanned capabilities, Russia is planning to increase the number of drones used in strikes against our state. We are preparing our countermeasures.”  Russia’s Defense Ministry said that 60 Ukrainian drones were downed overnight over several regions, including 17 over Crimea, 16 over the Rostov region and four over the Saratov region.  At the same time, four Russian Shahed drones struck the southern Ukraine city of Zaporizhzia during the night, leaving more than 1,600 households without power, according to authorities.  Ukraine’s air force said Tuesday that Russia fired 52 Shahed and decoy drones at the country overnight.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, rebuked Russia for continuing to strike civilian areas of Ukraine while effectively rejecting a ceasefire and dragging its feet on a peace settlement.  “We urge an immediate ceasefire and a move to trilateral talks to end the war,” Kellogg said on the social platform X late Monday. “Russia cannot continue to stall for time while it bombs civilian targets in Ukraine.”  Ukraine is developing its own defense industry as uncertainty remains over whether the Trump administration will continue to provide crucial military aid.  Between March and April, the United States allocated no new aid to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute, which tracks such support.  Europe continues its support and for the first time since June 2022 surpassed the U.S. in total military aid, totaling 72 billion euros ($85 billion) compared with 65 billion euros ($77 billion) from the U.S., the institute said last month.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday held their first direct telephone in almost three years.  The two leaders discussed the Iranian-Israeli war and the American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, a statement on the Kremlin’s website said. Putin and Macron also talked about a peaceful settlement to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the Russian president stressing that any agreements should “be comprehensive and long-term” and “based on new territorial realities,” the Kremlin statement said.  Macron’s office said that the French leader underlined “France’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” and “called for a ceasefire to be established as soon as possible” so that peace negotiations can be launched.  The two presidents last held direct talks in September 2022.  ___ Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report from Paris, France. ___  Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine        Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  ? Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration  WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans hauled President Donald Trump’s big tax breaks and spending cuts bill to passage Tuesday by the narrowest of margins, pushing past opposition from Democrats and their own GOP ranks after a turbulent overnight session.  Watch live as the Senate considers an endless stream of proposed amendments to President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, in what’s called a vote-a-rama.  The outcome capped an unusually tense weekend of work at the Capitol, the president’s signature legislative priority teetering on the edge of approval or collapse. In the end that tally was 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.  Three Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky — joined all Democrats in voting against it.  “In the end we got the job done,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said afterward.  The difficulty for Republicans, who have the majority in Congress, to wrestle the bill to this point is not expected to let up. The package now goes back to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana had warned senators not to overhaul what his chamber had already approved. But the Senate did make changes, particularly to Medicaid, risking more problems ahead. House GOP leaders scheduled a Wednesday vote and vowed to put it on Trump’s desk by his July Fourth deadline, which is Friday.  It’s a pivotal moment for the president and his party, as they have been consumed by the now 887-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which was its formal title before Democrats filed an amendment to strip out the name. Republicans are investing their political capital in delivering on their sweep of power in Washington.  Trump acknowledged it’s “very complicated stuff” as he departed the White House for Florida.  “I don’t want to go too crazy with cuts,” he said. “I don’t like cuts.”  What started as a routine but laborious day of amendment voting, in a process called vote-a-rama, spiraled into an all-night slog as Republican leaders bought time to shore up support.  The droning roll calls in the chamber belied the frenzied action to steady the bill. Grim-faced scenes played out on and off the Senate floor, amid exhaustion.  Thune worked around the clock, desperately reaching for last-minute agreements between those in his party worried the bill’s reductions to Medicaid will leave millions more people without care and his most conservative flank, which wanted even steeper cuts to hold down deficits ballooning with the tax cuts.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  The GOP leaders had no room to spare. Thune could lose no more than three Republican senators, and two — Tillis, who warned that millions of people will lose access to Medicaid health care, and Paul, who opposes raising the debt limit by $5 trillion — had already indicated opposition.  Attention quickly turned to two other key senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Collins, who also raised concerns about health care cuts, as well as a loose coalition of four conservative GOP senators pushing for even steeper reductions.

Thomas Tillis, R-N.C., speaks to reporters as Republicans begin a final push to advance President Donald Trump’s tax breaks and spending cuts package, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, June 30, 2025.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)  Murkowski in particular became the subject of GOP leaders’ attention, as they sat beside her for talks. Then all eyes were on Paul after he returned from a visit to Thune’s office.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans “are in shambles because they know the bill is so unpopular.”  An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. The CBO said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.  Pressure built from all sides. Billionaire Elon Musk said anyone who voted for the package should “hang their head in shame” and warned he would campaign against them. But Trump had also lashed out against the GOP holdouts, including Tillis, who abruptly announced his own decision over the weekend not to seek reelection.  Few Republicans appeared fully satisfied as the final package emerged, in either the House or the Senate.  Collins fought to include $50 billion for a new rural hospital fund, among the GOP senators worried that the bill’s Medicaid provider cuts would be devastating and force them to close.  While her amendment for the fund was rejected, the provision was inserted into the final bill. Still she voted no.  The Maine senator said she’s happy the bolstered funding was added, but “my difficulties with the bill go far beyond that.”  And Murkowski called the decision-making process “agonizing.”  She secured provisions to temporarily spare Alaska and other states from some food stamp cuts, but her efforts to bolster Medicaid reimbursements fell short. She voted yes.  All told, the Senate bill includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, according to the latest CBO analysis, making permanent Trump’s 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.  The Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits, which Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide. It would impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements on able-bodied people, including some parents and older Americans, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.  Additionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)  “The big not so beautiful bill has passed,” Paul said.  Unable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats tried to drag out the process, including with a weekend reading of the full bill.  Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, raised particular concern about the accounting method being used by the Republicans, which says the tax breaks from Trump’s first term are now “current policy” and the cost of extending them should not be counted toward deficits.  She said that kind of “magic math” won’t fly with Americans trying to balance their own household books.  ___  Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti, Darlene Superville, Seung Min Kim and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.

(Bill Buley/Coeur D’Alene Press via AP)  COEUR D’ALENE, Idaho (AP) — A 20-year-old man’s life appeared to have begun to unravel in the months before authorities say he fatally shot two firefighters and severely wounded a third as they responded to a wildfire near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho.  Wess Roley was living out of his vehicle and his former roommate, T.J. Franks Jr., said he shaved off his long hair and started to “kind of go downhill.” The two lived together for about six months in Sandpoint, Idaho, until Roley moved out in January, Franks said Monday.  Handout screenshots of suspect Wess Roley’s Instagram story are seen at the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office during a press conference the day after Roley ambushed, shot and killed multiple firefighters responding to a wildfire at Canfield Mountain Monday, June 30, 2025, in Hayden, Idaho.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)  Roley, who authorities say took his own life after Sunday’s shootings, is suspected of killing two battalion chiefs whose firefighting careers in Idaho spanned nearly half a century combined. The deaths of Frank Harwood, 42, with Kootenai County Fire and Rescue, and John Morrison, 52, with the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, have left their colleagues reeling, resulting in their departments adding law enforcement to every call, no matter how routine.    “I don’t know that we’re ever going to be able to guarantee people’s peace of mind, at least for a while after an incident like this,” Kootenai County Fire and Rescue Chief Christopher Way said. “But we are taking every measure we can to ensure safety of our responders.”  Roley had set a fire using flint at Canfield Mountain, a popular recreation area, according to authorities. The firefighters who rushed to the scene found themselves under fire and took cover behind fire trucks.  “There was an interaction with the firefighters,” Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said. “It has something to do with his vehicle being parked where it was.”  Two helicopters converged on the area, armed with snipers ready to take out the suspect if needed, while the FBI used his cellphone data to track him and the sheriff ordered residents to shelter in place. They eventually found Roley’s body in the mountains, his firearm beside him. He had killed himself, the sheriff said.

(Bill Buley/Coeur D’Alene Press via AP)  Roley had once aspired to be a firefighter and had only a handful of minor contacts with area police, Norris said. A motive was still unknown, he said.  He had ties to California and Arizona and was living in Idaho “for the better part of 2024,” although it was unclear why he was there, Norris said.  When Roley was living with Franks, his apartment cameras caught Roley throwing gang signs at them, which worried Franks to the point that he called police.  The landlord also called Franks one morning because neighbors reported that Roley’s vehicle had been left running for about 12 hours. Franks said Roley was asleep in his room and said he forgot about the vehicle.  Hours after Sunday’s shooting, people gathered along Interstate 90 holding American flags to pay their respects as the two fallen firefighters’ bodies were taken to the medical examiner’s office in Spokane, Washington, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) from Coeur d’Alene.

People dotted an overpass, where a fire truck bearing a large U.S. flag stood, as the procession passed on the interstate below.  Gov. Brad Little ordered U.S. and Idaho state flags to be lowered to half-staff to honor the firefighters until the day after their memorial service.  “All our public safety officers, especially our firefighters, bravely confront danger on a daily basis but we have never seen a heinous act of violence like this on our firefighters before,” he said in a statement.  Harwood, one of the victims of the shooting, had been with the county fire department for 17 years, Kootenai County Fire and Rescue Chief Christopher Way said during a news conference Monday. Harwood was married and had two children, and he also was a veteran of the Army National Guard.  Morrison, who was also killed, started his career with the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department in 1996 and had also worked as a paramedic.

By Monday afternoon, the fire was “reasonably contained,” and responders had “stopped significant forward progress,” Way said. The Idaho Department of Lands said it had burned about 26 acres (10.5 hectares).

NEW YORK (AP) — The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ sex trafficking trial said Tuesday that it has reached a verdict on four of five counts against the hip-hop mogul. But the partial decision remained under wraps after jurors were told to keep deliberating because they were stuck on the top charge, racketeering conspiracy.  Prosecutors, Combs’ defense team and Judge Arun Subramanian reasoned that after just two days of deliberations, it was too soon to give up on reaching a verdict on all counts. So rather than taking a partial verdict, Subramanian told the jury to continue weighing the remaining charge. Deliberations will continue Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)  Xavier Donaldson, defense attorney for Sean “Diddy” Combs, arrives at court on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)  The developments came late Tuesday afternoon, when the jury sent a note saying it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because there were jurors with “unpersuadable” views on both sides.  But in less than 13 hours of deliberations, the jury did reach a verdict on two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. The latter concerns allegations of arranging to fly the women and sex workers across state lines.  If there is a conviction, the sex trafficking charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life. Transportation to engage in prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  The outstanding charge, racketeering conspiracy, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.    After hearing about the jury note, Combs, 55, appeared morose as his lawyers spoke with him. At one point, the hip-hop mogul solemnly read a piece of paper that attorney Marc Agnifilo handed to him.  After the jury came in for instructions and then exited the room, a subdued Combs sat in his chair for a few minutes. As he stood to leave, he faced his relatives and supporters in the audience, blew a kiss and tapped his heart, as he frequently has done at the start and end of each day.  Then he paused before his mother and exchanged a few words, telling her, “Love you” and “I’ll be all right.”    Marshals then led him from the room.  Jurors are weighing charges that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force two girlfriends into drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers known as “freak-offs” or “hotel nights.”  AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on a partial verdict in the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex trafficking trial.  He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers contend prosecutors are trying to criminalize Combs’ swinger lifestyle and that, if anything, his conduct amounted to domestic violence, not federal felonies.  Racketeering conspiracy is the most complicated charge because it requires the jury to decide not only whether Combs ran a “racketeering enterprise,” but also whether he was involved in committing such offenses as some or all of various types of offenses, such as kidnapping and arson.  Earlier Tuesday, the jury asked to review critical testimony from one of the prosecution’s most important witnesses: the hip-hop mogul’s former longtime girlfriend Cassie, the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura.  The panel of eight men and four women asked for Cassie’s account of Combs beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 — an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage.  They also asked to see Cassie’s testimony about when she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.  In addition, the jury asked for Cassie and stripper Daniel Phillip’s testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel. Phillip testified that “she was terrified,” and he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.  Phillip testified that he told her she was in real danger. Cassie, he said, “basically tried to convince me that it was OK: ‘It’s OK. I’m fine, I’ll be OK.’”  AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on day 2 of deliberations at Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ sex trafficking trial.  Tuesday’s court session began with the lawyers and judge considering the jury’s request late Monday for clarification about what qualifies as drug distribution, an aspect of the racketeering conspiracy charge.  Subramanian ultimately reminded jurors of instructions he’d already given on that part of the case.  On Monday, barely an hour into deliberations, the foreperson sent a note complaining that there was one juror “who we are concerned cannot follow your Honor’s instructions.”  In response, the judge reminded jurors of their duties to deliberate and follow his instructions on the law.  At the trial, Combs chose not to testify. His lawyers built their arguments for acquittal mostly through lengthy cross-examinations of dozens of prosecution witnesses.

"Trump will visit immigration detention site in the Florida Everglades","Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.    Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  President Donald Trump visited a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades on Tuesday as state officials showcased what critics are condemning as an inhumane makeshift prison camp and what supporters are embracing as a national model for aggressively ramping up detention and deportation efforts.  OCHOPEE, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday toured a new immigration detention center surrounded by alligator-filled swamps in the Florida Everglades, suggesting it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.  Trump said he’d like to see similar facilities in “really, many states” and raised the prospect of also deporting U.S. citizens. He even endorsed having Florida National Guard forces possibly serve as immigration judges to ensure migrants are ejected from the country even faster.  “Pretty soon, this facility will handle the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet,” Trump said of the Florida site known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”  The president said the moniker is “very appropriate because I looked outside and that’s not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon.”  “The only way out, really, is deportation,” Trump added.  Hundreds of protesters converged outside the site — a remote airstrip with tents and trailers. They waved signs calling for the humane treatment of migrants as well as the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to a few Native American tribes and many endangered animal species.    The White House has delighted in the area’s remoteness — about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Miami — and the fact that it is teeming with pythons and alligators. It hopes to convey a message to detainees and the rest of the world that repercussions will be severe if the immigration laws of the United States are not followed.  Before arriving, Trump even joked of migrants being held there, “We’re going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.”  Environmental advocates and protesters at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport on Tamiami Trail E, Ochopee, Fla., on Saturday, June 28, 2025, object to the “Alligator Alcatraz” being built at the facility.

(Mike Stocker /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP)  “Don’t run in a straight line. Run like this,” Trump said, as he moved his hand in a zigzag motion. “And you know what? Your chances go up about 1%.” Alligator experts suggest it is better to dash in one direction in the rare situation when the reptile gives chase, according to a website run by the University of Florida.  Trump on his tour walked through medical facilities and other parts of the detention center, then held a lengthy roundtable where Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and assorted state and federal officials heaped him with praise.  Authorities originally suggested it could house up to 5,000 detainees upon completion, but DeSantis said it would actually hold around 3,000, with some starting to arrive Wednesday.  The center was built in eight days over 10 miles (16 kilometers) of Everglades. It features more than 200 security cameras, 28,000-plus feet (8,500 meters) of barbed wire and 400 security personnel.  Trump dismissed concerns about the impact on delicate ecosystems, saying that since the airstrip was already there, authorities wouldn’t have to be “dropping dirt.”  “I don’t think you’ve done anything to the Everglades,” Trump said. “I think you’re just enhancing it.”  Other, though, are appalled, including Phyllis Andrews, a retired teacher who drove from Naples, Florida, to protest Trump’s visit and called migrants “fine people.”  “They do not deserve to be incarcerated here,” Andrews said.  Some Trump supporters showed up near the detention center as well, including Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys whom Trump pardoned for his conviction related to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. He suggested Trump won last year’s election because voters wanted “mass deportation” and “retribution.”  Crackdowns on the U.S.-Mexico border and harsh immigration policies have long been a centerpiece of Trump’s political brand. During his first term, Trump denied reports that he floated the idea of building a moat filled with alligators at the southern border.  Trump has more recently suggested that his administration could reopen Alcatraz, the notorious island prison off San Francisco. The White House similarly promoted the political shock value of sending some immigrants awaiting deportation to a detention lockup in Guant?namo Bay, Cuba, and others to a megaprison in El Salvador.  His administration has vowed that mass deportations are coming, even if some of those notions are impractical. Transforming Alcatraz from a tourist attraction into a prison would be very costly, and Guant?namo Bay is being used less often than administration officials originally envisioned.  Trump also mused Tuesday about deporting dangerous people born in the United States, like ones who “knife you when you’re walking down the street” or who kill people from behind with a baseball bat.

(Planet Labs PBC via AP)  “They’re not new to our country. They’re old to our country. Many of them were born in our country. I think we ought to get them the hell out of here, too,” Trump said. “So maybe that’ll be the next job that we’ll work on together.”  Alluding to his criminal indictments during President Joe Biden’s administration, Trump said of the detention facility, “Biden wanted me here,” using an expletive to describe his predecessor.  Florida plans to offer up members of the National Guard to be “deputized” and assist immigration judges as a way to loosen another chokepoint in the country’s long-overburdened immigration court system. Guard personnel could provide security along the perimeter and entry control points and help staff the site, officials say.  The detention center has an estimated annual cost of $450 million, but state officials say at least some of that will be covered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency — which is best known for responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.  During his tour, Trump greeted around 20 FEMA employees and construction workers and bonded with DeSantis, who once bitterly challenged him for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.  “We have blood that seems to match pretty well,” Trump said of Florida’s governor. When DeSantis suggested that members of the Guard could ease immigration judges’ workloads, Trump offered, “He didn’t even have to ask me. He has my approval.”  A spokesperson for the Guard said that its members aren’t currently tasked with detention or enforcement operations and that doing so would require training from federal authorities.  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was also on the tour, said immigrants arriving to the site could still opt to “self-deport” and board flights to their home countries rather than being held in it. She said she hoped “my phone rings off the hook” with other states looking to follow Florida’s lead and open similar sites.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees are generally held for reasons like entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa. They are either waiting for ICE to put them on the next flight or bus ride home, or they’re fighting their removal in immigration court.  As of mid-June, ICE detention facilities held more than 56,000 immigrants, the most since 2019.  During his visit, Trump was informed that the sweeping tax cut and spending bill the White House has championed had cleared the Senate, drawing applause. He suggested his being in Florida, rather than helping promote the bill in Washington, underscored how important immigration was as an issue.  “I’m here, and I probably should be there,” he said, shortly before flying back to the White House.  ___  Weissert reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans are inching closer to getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final Senate vote likely late Monday or early Tuesday.  At some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.  Democrats are united against the legislation and were offering scores of amendments to alter it Monday as the Senate slogged through what is known as a vote-a-rama. Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments, with each receiving a vote. Once the bill clears the Senate, it would have to pass the House before Trump can sign it into law.

Scott Applewhite)  Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate.  Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.  The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.    It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.  A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.  There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.  The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.  Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.  The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.  Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.  The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.  To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.  For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.  To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor.  Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.  The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.  More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.  The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It’s a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.  Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden’s 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering healthcare costs.  Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a “death sentence for America’s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.”  Under the bill, a tax credit that subsidizes the production of electricity would be eliminated for any wind and solar plant not plugged into the grid by the end of 2027. But Republicans aren’t just looking to roll back the tax breaks Biden put into place: they’re also looking to add a tax for new wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.  A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.  Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.  A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.  The House and Senate both have a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.  The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”  There’s a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.  Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.  Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.  The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors have asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.  Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.  Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.  Or not, depending on how one does the math.  Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.  Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost a half-trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.  Democrats say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country’s fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that take. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans are employing an “accounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.”        Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.
